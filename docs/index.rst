Welcome to the documentation page for **Us Who Remain**, a tabletop role-playing game centered around small animals finding their way through a thriving but danger-fraught post-human world.

Most core rules are derived from `the Unofficial Hollow Knight RPG <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWPQ9Yv7kkLrleCIlf8vSJHHxvA6-T0D/view>`__ and the fantastic folks working on it. Please check it out as well!

As is with the UHKRPG, any commercial distribution to anyone under any circumstances is strictly prohibited, but otherwise feel free to distribute and modify with credit given.
