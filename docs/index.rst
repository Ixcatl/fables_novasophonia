Welcome to the documentation page for **Us Who Remain**, a tabletop role-playing game centered around animal people finding their way through a thriving but danger-fraught Renaissance world.

Most core rules are derived from `the Unofficial Hollow Knight RPG <https://hkrpg-team.itch.io/hollow-knight-rpg>`__ and the fantastic folks working on it. Please check it out as well!

As is with HKRPG, any commercial distribution to anyone under any circumstances is strictly prohibited, but otherwise feel free to share with your friends and/or tabletop group and modify the rules to your heart's content.
