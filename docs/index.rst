Welcome to the documentation page for **Us Who Remain**, a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) centered around small animals adventuring through a thriving but danger-fraught post-human world.

Most core rules (and wording; my deepest apologies, for I am lazy) are derived from `the Unofficial Hollow Knight RPG <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWPQ9Yv7kkLrleCIlf8vSJHHxvA6-T0D/view>`__. Please check out their work as well!

Personal distribution and modification of this rulebook is encouraged. Any commercial distribution to anyone under any circumstances is strictly prohibited.
