  .. tab-item:: Rank 1
      
    | **Lancing Strikes**
    | You may attack with melee weapons using Grace to hit instead of Might, but not with heavy weapons. Lance-type weapons are an exception to this limit.
    | 
    | **Sharp Lunge**
    | You may accept a -1 die penalty on your attack roll for any melee or thrown attack to increase the range of the attack by 1. This is treated as a free dash, and enhanced by dash distance increases.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Battle Rhythm**
    | During combat, when you take a dash or jump action, move while dodging, or use an ability that moves yourself, you gain 1 stack of Momentum. After initiating an attack or dodge action with Stamina, you may dedicate stacks of Momentum as if they were additional Stamina.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Untouchable**
    | 6s rolled on dodge attempts are treated as two successes. When you move while dodging, you do not suffer a stack of Off-Balance.

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Power Attack**
    | Any time you dedicate at least 3 Stamina to an attack or weapon art, it gains +1 base damage. This bonus is increased to +2 if the attack is made with a heavy weapon or club-type weapon.

    | Whenever you end your turn with 0 Stamina, you regain 1 Stamina.
    | 
    | **Uproot**
    | You may attack empty squares with your weapon at 1 Stamina cost, creating :term:`rough terrain`. Creatures burrowed within the terrain at the time take 2 damage and are forced to surface.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Law of Conservation**
    | You treat taxed Stamina spent during an attack as dedicated to that attack, increasing the number of dice rolled as usual. Additionally, when Stamina is spent to clear stacks of Off-Balance, treat the Stamina as dedicated to your next attack.

Flavor prefix: "Cunning"

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    | 
    | *You learn two trap blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Hair Trigger**
    | You may deploy traps at a range of 3. When you set a trap, it can be given a more sensitive trigger, expanding its activation squares to the squares adjacent. A single target trap will target the creature that triggered it, while those with an area of effect will still originate from the trap itself.
    | 
    | *You learn another trap blueprint of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Fighting Dirty**
    | After successfully dealing damage to a target, or affecting them with any kind of flask or trap, you may use dirty tactics to inflict a status effect which lowers any one of the target's primary attributes by 1, or their Speed by 2. The status effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
    |
    | *You learn another trap blueprint of any rarity.*

Berserker
-------
Flavor prefix: "Raging"

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Onslaught**
    | After you make an attack, and your target makes a defense roll, you may choose to reroll a number of failures up to twice your Berserker rank. If you do, roll a d6. If the result is less than your current Vitality, you suffer 2 :term:`true damage <damage type: true>`.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Burnout**

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Glancing Blows**
    | If an attack you attempt to parry still risks damage after the attempt, you gain +1 :term:`favor` for your soak roll against it.
    | 
    | **Watchful Eye**
    | The first attack of opportunity you make each round costs no Stamina to initiate.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Withstand**
    | Whenever you take soakable damage during a round, you gain +1 bonus die when soaking further damage. This effect stacks indefinitely and resets at the start of your next turn.
    | 
    | **Force of Will**
    | When you take a focus action to heal, you may choose to restore Durability to your worn armor in lieu of Vitality.
    | In addition, while taking any focus action, you increase your effective Mettle score by 2 until no longer focusing.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Impassable**
    | Squares adjacent to you count as :term:`rough terrain` against trespassers. Flying or Leaping creatures crossing over these squares (using your melee weapon's range upwards) are forced to land, though this does not end their turn.
    | 
    | **Martial Defense**
    | You may use normal weapon arts as attacks of opportunity or activate an augmentation art during an attack of opportunity, bypassing the arts per turn limit.

--------

Ranger
------
Flavor prefix: "Deft"

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1



  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Rebound**
    | Once per round, should your thrown or ranged attack be dodged or parried, it can ricochet to a target adjacent to the first. The ricocheted attack inherits the same number of successes as the original, and is otherwise functionally identical. If the original target was adjacent to a wall, the ricochet may instead target them a second time. An attack cannot ricochet more than once.


  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

--------

Arbalist
--------
Flavor prefix: "Deadeye"

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Good Arm**
    | You may attack with ranged weapons using Might to hit instead of Grace.
    | 
    | **Long Shot**

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Zero In**
    | At the end of your turn, you may choose a target square to focus your sights on. At the end of your turns thereafter, including this one, you gain 1 stack of Aim - allowing you to ignore 2 die penalties from Long Shot against any targets in that square - which stacks up to 2. If you are moved or defend yourself at any point, one stack of Aim is lost, per 2 squares rounded up if moved. During your turn, you may also spend 1 Aim to move the target square 2 squares in any direction, or choose a new square, which resets all Aim.
    | If the target square is within your normal range, you gain +1 die to ranged or spell attack rolls against any targets in that square, as long as you have at least one stack of Aim.
    |
    | **Overwatch**

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Set Dressing**
    | When you make a thrown or natural ranged attack that will not directly impact a creature or affect an occupied square, the attack is unaffected by Stamina tax, and does not increase it. You may also pair thrown flasks with any weapon.
    |
    | *You learn three flask blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Controlled Environment**
    | When you throw a flask, you may increase its terrain effect radius by one, targeted effects instead being applied as a 3x3 AoE. Flasks thrown can ignore a number of allies or squares within their effect radius up to your Bombardier rank.
    | Areas of effect from natural ranged weapons or hand pumps may also have their size increased by 1, and ignore a number of allies or squares up to your Bombardier Rank.
    | 
    | **Efficient Reagents**
    | When crafting a flask, potion, or poison, roll a d6. On a success, up to 25 value in materials used may be refunded.
    |
    | *You learn another two new common or uncommon flask blueprints.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Chemical Admixture**
    | While in possession of two non-rare flasks, you may combine them at any time. Choose one flask to be the "carrier" and another to be the "payload". Natural ranged weapons may act as a carrier.
    | Choose one of the payload's targeted or terrain effects. If the effect is targeted, it applies to all creatures the carrier's effects apply to. If the effect is terrain, it applies to all tiles the carrier applies to, or the tiles of creatures the carrier affects.
    | 
    | *You learn another two new flask blueprints of any rarity.*

  <blurb>

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Astral Conduit**
    | You may pour some of your Anima into an ordinary object, ossifying it and transforming it into an *astral conduit*. The conduit can store a maximum amount of Anima equal to your Arcanist rank. You may have only one astral conduit, and creating a new one destroys the old. While holding a conduit or carrying it on the Belt, you or a friendly adjacent character with Arcanist ranks may spend 1 Stamina to draw any amount of Anima from it. As a focus action, you can deposit any amount of Anima into your existing conduit, or create a new one.
    |
    | **Sorcerous Casting**
    | You may treat your attuned arcane focus as a weapon with the Sorcerous modifier, if it can be used as one. Talismans instead make your unarmed attacks and grapples Sorcerous.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **TBD**
    | tbd
    |
    | **Prudent Research**
    | When performing research to learn a new spell, if you have access to a grimoire containing the spell, two dice on your research roll are guaranteed successes.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

Thaumaturge
---------

Flavor prefix: "Thaumetic"

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  Any astronomer worth their salt regards Pandemonium as one of the most potent sources of magic in the Corporeum, but harnessing latent chaos without grave error is another matter of miracle-making entirely.

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Sacred Geometry**
    | As a focus action costing 1 Stamina and 1 Anima, you may etch a ritual shape into the square beneath you. For larger characters, these *ley lines* encompass squares equal to your body size, and only function when standing within all of them. Your ley lines are unique to you and cannot be used by others; furthermore, you may only have one set of ley lines at a time.
    | While standing within your ley lines, you may choose to cast any spell as a focus action instead. When the focus resolves and the spell is cast, roll a number of dice equal to your ranks in the path used to cast the spell. You restore Anima equal to the successes of this roll, capped at the original cost of the spell.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Mind Bloom**
    | When you make an opposed Insight check either as part of a spell or ability, or to resist a spell or ability, you may dedicate Anima to that check as bonus dice. This does not include traditional attack rolls.
    | While standing within your ley lines, one bonus die is granted for free.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Astral Projection**
    | When you cast an area of effect spell that would originate from your square, you may instead have it originate from anywhere within its ordinary range. Spells cast this way retain the same direction and range with which they were cast originally.
    | While standing within your ley lines, if you cast a spell of 4 difficulty or greater, you receive 1 difficulty in free modification for that spell.
    |
    | **Chimeric Spells**
    | When attuning spells, you may splice two spells together into one, combining their difficulty. The second spell's effect is additionally carried by the first, in a way arbitrated by the GM if needed. If the first spell has an AoE, the total difficulty increases by 1. The second spell's path is considered the first spell's path, but the spliced spell's path difficulty cap is limited by the lower of the two. Two AoE spells cannot be spliced together.

Irregular Paths
============
These paths are unique in one or more ways, owing to complex mechanics, gimmicks deeper than other paths, or more important story hooks. They still count as either martial or mystic, but are separated nonetheless for their deeper gameplay ramifications.
