.. Note::
  "Secondary Path prefix" refers to either a character's second highest rank Path or their second oldest Path, and may be applied as a prefix to their primary Path title purely for flavor. Design a Noble Rogue, or a Ruinous Champion!

--------

Martial Paths
=============

--------

Duelist (sword)
------
Secondary Path prefix: "Noble"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Guard Breaker**
| The Duelist strikes more accurately while focusing on one opponent. Their attack rolls against the most recent enemy(s) they have successfully damaged have +1 :term:`favor`.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Battle Stance**
| When an enemy enters a square adjacent to the Duelist from a square not adjacent to them, they provoke an automatic attack of opportunity.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Martial Master**
| The Duelist may perform an additional Weapon Art per turn.

--------

Rogue (spear)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Dashing"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Swift Strikes**
| The Rogue may attack using Grace instead of Brawn to hit with melee weapons, but not with heavy weapons. Spear-type weapons are an exception to this rule.
| 
| **Sharp Lunge**
| The Rogue may accept a -1 die penalty on their attack roll for any melee or thrown weapon attack to increase the range of the attack by 1. This is treated as a free dash, and enhanced by dash distance increases.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Battle Dance**
| During combat, when the Rogue takes a dash or jump action, moves while dodging, or uses an ability that moves them, they gain 1 point of Momentum. After initiating an attack or dodge action with Stamina, the Rogue may dedicate Momentum as if it were additional Stamina.
| Momentum can be stored up to a maximum of the Rogue's rank, and points fade at the end of the Rogue's next turn after they are gained.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Untouchable**
| 6s the Rogue rolls on dodge attempts count as two successes instead of one. When they move while dodging, they do not suffer a stack of Off-Balance.

--------

Warrior (club)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Unrelenting"

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  .. div:: sd-mb-1

    Placeholder

  .. div:: sd-text-right

    -- placeholder person

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Power Attack**
| Any time the Warrior dedicates at least 3 Stamina to an attack or Art, it deals an additional 1 point of base damage. This damage is increased to 2 if the attack is made with a heavy weapon or club weapon. If performing an Art with an area of effect or multiple attacks, the Warrior must spend an additional 1 taxed Stamina to make it a Power Attack.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Second Wind**
| Whenever the Warrior ends their turn with 0 Stamina, they regain 1 Stamina.
| 
| **Uproot**
| The Warrior may attack empty squares at 1 Stamina cost, creating :term:`rough terrain`. Characters burrowed within the terrain take 2 damage and are forced to surface.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Law of Conservation**
| The Warrior treats taxed Stamina in an attack as dedicated to that attack, increasing the number of dice rolled as usual. Additionally, when Stamina is spent to clear stacks of Off-Balance, treat the Stamina as dedicated to the Warrior's next attack.

--------

Hellion (hook)
---------
Secondary Path prefix: "Crooked"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Slice of Hand**
| The Hellion may attack using Grace instead of Brawn to hit with melee weapons, but not with heavy weapons.
| 
| **Push and Pull**
| When the Hellion successfully risks damage with an attack, they may choose to risk 1 less damage. If they do, they can move the struck target one square in any direction, or two if using a heavy weapon.
| 
| **Bag of Tricks**
| The Hellion gains access to a Stash pool, which increases by 1, and learns two trap recipes of common or uncommon rarity.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Clever Tricks**
| The Hellion may deploy traps at a range of 3. When they set a trap, it can be given a more sensitive trigger, expanding its activation squares to the squares adjacent. A single target trap will target the character that triggered it, while ones which affect an area will originate from its original position.
| The Hellion's maximum Stash also increases by 1, and they learn a new common or uncommon trap recipe.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Cheat to Win**
| After successfully dealing damage to a target or affecting it with any kind of flask or trap, the Hellion may use dirty tactics to inflict a status effect which lowers any one of the target's primary Attributes by 1, or their Speed by 2. The status effect lasts until the Hellion's next turn.
| The Hellion's maximum Stash also increases by 1, and they learn a new trap recipe of any rarity.

--------

Wastrel (natural)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Desperate"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Frenzy**
| After the Wastrel makes an attack, and the target defends, they may choose to reroll a number of failures up to twice their Wastrel rank. If they do, a d6 is rolled. If the result is less than the Wastrel's current Vitality, they suffer 2 :term:`true damage`.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Burnout**
| When making an attack, parrying, or dodging, the Wastrel may spend or dedicate Vitality in place of Stamina, as long as at least 1 Stamina has already been dedicated to the action.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Bloodlust**
| Slaying an enemy restores 1 Vitality to the Wastrel. If the attack was made using a natural weapon, 2 Vitality is restored instead.

--------

Champion (armor)
------
Secondary Path prefix: "Stalwart"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Glancing Blows**
| If an attack that the Champion attempts to parry still risks damage after the attempt, their Soak dice have +1 :term:`favor`.
| 
| **Watchful Eye**
| The first attack of opportunity a Champion makes each round costs no Stamina to initiate.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Withstand**
| Whenever the Champion takes damage, they gain an additional 1 Soak die against further damage that round. This effect stacks for up to 3 additional dice.
| 
| **Force of Will** (wip)
| The Champion may use a Focus action to roll their base Mettle score, repairing their armor by 1 point for each success.
| In addition, while taking any Focus action, the Champion increases their Mettle score by 2 until the start of their next turn.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Impassable**
| Squares adjacent to the Champion count as :term:`rough terrain` for their foes. Flying or Leaping enemies crossing over those squares are forced to land, though this does not end their turn.
| 
| **Martial Defense**
| The Champion may use Normal Weapon Arts as attacks of opportunity, or activate an Augmentation Art during an attack of opportunity, bypassing the Arts per turn limit.

Mystic Paths
============

Ascendant
---------

Secondary Path prefix: "Eminent"

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  All living things, willfully or not, are destined to rise above one another; thus is the way of nature. Is it not simply natural, then, to seek the truest final Ascension, learning from the folly of those who came before?

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Astral Conduit**
| The Ascendant may pour some of their Magic into an ordinary object, transforming it into an Astral Conduit. The Conduit can store a maximum amount of Magic points equal to its creator's Ascendant rank. They may have only one Astral Conduit, and creating a new one destroys the old one. While holding a Conduit or carrying it on the Belt, the Ascendant or another character with Ascendant ranks may spend 1 Stamina to draw any amount of Magic from it. As a Focus action, the Ascendant can either deposit any amount of Magic into their existing Conduit, or create a new one.
|
| **Sorcerous Casting**
| The Ascendant may treat all arcane foci as weapons with the Sorcerous modifier. Talismans instead make the Ascendant's unarmed strikes and grapples Sorcerous.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Mind Made Manifest**
| When the Ascendant makes an opposed Insight check either as part of an Arcanum or ability, or to resist an Arcanum or ability, they may dedicate Magic to that check as additional dice.
|
| **Unnatural Selection**
| When the Ascendant successfully damages at least one character with an Arcanum, they gain 1 Magic.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Spellcrafting**
| When attuning Arcana, the Ascendant may splice two Arcana together into one, merging their Difficulty. The second Arcanum's effect is additionally carried by the first, in a way determined by the GM if needed. If the delivery Arcanum is an AoE, the total Difficulty increases by 1. The triggered Arcanum's Path is counted as the delivery Arcanum's Path. Two AoE Arcana cannot be spliced together.
|
| **Thin the Veil**
| When the Ascendant casts an area of effect Arcanum that would originate from the Ascendant's square in a line, cone, or burst, they may instead have it originate from anywhere within the Arcanum's ordinary range. Arcana cast this way retain the same direction in which they were cast originally.
