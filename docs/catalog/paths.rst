.. Note::
  "Secondary Path prefix" refers to either a character's second highest rank Path or their second oldest Path, and may be applied as a prefix to their primary Path title purely for flavor if desired. Design a Noble Thaumaturge, or a Fell Champion!

--------

Martial Paths
=============

--------

Duelist (sword)
------
Secondary Path prefix: "Noble"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Guard Breaker**
| The Duelist strikes more accurately while focusing on one opponent. Their attack rolls against the most recent enemy(s) they have successfully damaged have +1 :term:`favor`.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Battle Stance**
| When an enemy enters a square adjacent to the Duelist from a square not adjacent to them, they provoke an automatic attack of opportunity.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Martial Master**
| The Duelist may perform an additional Weapon Art per turn.

--------

Cavalier (spear)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Dashing"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Lancing Strikes**
| The Cavalier may attack with melee weapons using Grace to hit instead of Brawn, but not with heavy weapons. Spear weapons are an exception to this rule.
| 
| **Sharp Lunge**
| The Cavalier may accept a -1 die penalty on their attack roll for any melee or thrown weapon attack to increase the range of the attack by 1. This is treated as a free dash, and enhanced by dash distance increases.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Battle Rhythm**
| During combat, when the Cavalier takes a dash or jump action, moves while dodging, or uses an ability that moves them, they gain 1 point of Momentum. After initiating an attack or dodge action with Stamina, the Cavalier may dedicate Momentum as if it were additional Stamina.
| Momentum can be stored up to a maximum of the Cavalier's rank, and points fade at the end of the Cavalier's next turn after they are gained.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Untouchable**
| 6s the Cavalier rolls on dodge attempts count as two successes instead of one. When they move while dodging, they do not suffer a stack of Off-Balance.

--------

Warrior (club)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Ruthless"

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  .. div:: sd-mb-1

    Placeholder

  .. div:: sd-text-right

    -- placeholder person

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Power Attack**
| Any time the Warrior dedicates at least 3 Stamina to an attack or Art, it deals an additional 1 point of base damage. This bonus is increased to 2 if the attack is made with a heavy weapon or club weapon. If performing an Art with an area of effect or multiple attacks, the Warrior must spend an additional 1 taxed Stamina to make it a Power Attack.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Second Wind**
| Whenever the Warrior ends their turn with 0 Stamina, they regain 1 Stamina.
| 
| **Uproot**
| The Warrior may attack empty squares at 1 Stamina cost, creating :term:`rough terrain`. Characters burrowed within the terrain take 2 damage and are forced to surface.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Law of Conservation**
| The Warrior treats taxed Stamina spent during an attack as dedicated to that attack, increasing the number of dice rolled as usual. Additionally, when Stamina is spent to clear stacks of Off-Balance, treat the Stamina as dedicated to the Warrior's next attack.

--------

Rogue (hook)
---------
Secondary Path prefix: "Crooked"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Swift Strikes**
| The Rogue may attack with melee weapons using Grace to hit instead of Brawn, but not with heavy weapons.
| 
| **Push and Pull**
| When the Rogue succeeds and risks damage with an attack, they may choose to risk 1 less damage. If they do, they can move the struck target one square in any direction, or two if using a heavy weapon.
| 
| **Bag of Tricks**
| The Rogue learns two trap blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Hair Trigger**
| The Rogue may deploy traps at a range of 3. When they set a trap, it can be given a more sensitive trigger, expanding its activation squares to the squares adjacent. A single target trap will target the character that triggered it, while ones which affect an area will originate from its original position.
| The Rogue also learns a new common or uncommon trap blueprint.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Cheat to Win**
| After successfully dealing damage to a target or affecting it with any kind of flask or trap, the Rogue may use dirty tactics to inflict a status effect which lowers any one of the target's primary Attributes by 1, or their Speed by 2. The status effect lasts until the beginning of the Rogue's next turn.
| The Rogue also learns a new trap blueprint of any rarity.

--------

Berserker (natural)
-------
Secondary Path prefix: "Frenzied"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Frenzy**
| After the Berserker makes an attack, and the target defends, they may choose to reroll a number of failures up to twice their Berserker rank. If they do, a d6 is rolled. If the result is less than the Predator's current Vitality, they suffer 2 :term:`true damage <damage type: true>`.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Burnout**
| When making an attack, parrying, or dodging, the Predator may spend or dedicate Vitality in place of Stamina, as long as at least 1 Stamina has already been dedicated to the action.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Bloodlust**
| Slaying an enemy restores 1 Vitality to the Predator. If the attack was made using a natural weapon, 2 Vitality is restored instead.

--------

Champion (armor)
------
Secondary Path prefix: "Stalwart"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Glancing Blows**
| If an attack the Champion attempts to parry still risks damage after the attempt, their Soak dice have +1 :term:`favor`.
| 
| **Watchful Eye**
| The first attack of opportunity a Champion makes each round costs no Stamina to initiate.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Withstand**
| Whenever the Champion takes damage during a round, they gain an additional 1 Soak die against further damage. This effect stacks indefinitely and lasts until the start of the Champion's next turn.
| 
| **Force of Will**
| When the Champion Focuses to heal, they may choose to restore durability to their worn armor in lieu of Vitality.
| In addition, while taking any Focus action, the Champion increases their effective Mettle score by 2 until no longer Focusing.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Impassable**
| Squares adjacent to the Champion count as :term:`rough terrain` against trespassers. Flying or Leaping enemies crossing over those squares are forced to land, though this does not end their turn.
| 
| **Martial Defense**
| The Champion may use Normal Weapon Arts as attacks of opportunity or activate an Augmentation Art during an attack of opportunity, bypassing the Arts per turn limit.

--------

Ranger (light ranged)
------
Secondary Path prefix: "Deft"

Rank 1
~~~~~~

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Rebound**
| Once per round, should the Ranger's ranged attack be dodged or parried, it can ricochet to a target adjacent to the first. The ricochet attack inherits the same number of successes as the original. If the original target was adjacent to a wall, the ricochet may instead target it a second time. An attack cannot ricochet more than once.

Rank 3
~~~~~~

--------

Arbalist (heavy ranged)
--------
Secondary Path prefix: "Deadeye"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Good Arm**
| The Arbalist may attack with ranged weapons using Brawn to hit instead of Grace.
| 
| **Long Shot**
| When an Arbalist makes a ranged attack or Arcanum, its range can be increased by up to twice its original range. Each square beyond its original range inflicts a -1 die penalty on the attack roll.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Line Up** (wip)
| At the end of their turn, the Arbalist may declare a target to focus their attention on. If both the target and Arbalist remain in their respective spaces by the beginning of the Arbalist's next turn, the Arbalist gains a +2 die bonus to their first attack, as long as it is against the focused target. This bonus stacks up to 3 times.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Bullseye**
| 6s rolled when the Arbalist makes a ranged attack are treated as 2 successes.

--------

Bombardier (flask)
---------
Secondary Path prefix: "Volatile"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Easy Toss**
| When the Alchemist makes a thrown or natural ranged weapon attack that will not directly impact a living target or affect an occupied square, the attack is unaffected by Stamina tax, and does not increase it. The Alchemist may also pair thrown flasks with any weapon.
| 
| **Chemical Warfare**
| The Alchemist learns three flask blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Controlled Burst**
| When the Alchemist throws a flask, they may increase its terrain effect radius by one, and targeted flasks may be applied as a 3x3 AoE. Flasks thrown may ignore a number of allies or spaces within their effect radius up to the Alchemist's rank.
| Areas of effect from natural ranged weapons or hand pumps may also be increased by one, or by one cone size, and ignore a number of allies or spaces up to the Alchemist's Rank.
| 
| **Efficient Reagents**
| When creating a Stash item, the Alchemist rolls a d6. On a success, 1 Stash is refunded from the item's cost. **(TO BE REDONE)**
| The Alchemist also learns two new common or uncommon flask blueprints.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Chemical Admixture**
| While in possession of two non-rare flasks, the Alchemist may combine them. Choose one flask to be the "Carrier" and another to be the "Payload". Natural ranged weapons may act as a Carrier.
| Choose one of the Payload's Targeted or Terrain effects. If the effect is Targeted, it applies to all characters the Carrier's effects apply to. If the effect is Terrain, it affects all tiles the Carrier applies to, as well as the tiles of characters the Carrier affects.
| The Alchemist also learns two new flask blueprints of any rarity.

Thaumaturge
---------

Secondary Path prefix: "Thaumetic"

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  Any astronomer worth their salt knows Pandemonium is one of the most potent sources of magic in the Corporeum, but harnessing its mutinous chaos without grave error is another matter of miracle-making entirely.

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Astral Conduit**
| The Ascendant may pour some of their Magic into an ordinary object, transforming it into an Astral Conduit. The Conduit can store a maximum amount of Magic points equal to its creator's Ascendant rank. They may have only one Astral Conduit, and creating a new one destroys the old one. While holding a Conduit or carrying it on the Belt, the Ascendant (or another adjacent character with Ascendant ranks, and the Ascendant's permission) may spend 1 Stamina to draw any amount of Magic from it. As a Focus action, the Ascendant can either deposit any amount of Magic into their existing Conduit, or create a new one.
|
| **Sorcerous Casting**
| The Ascendant may treat all arcane foci as weapons with the Sorcerous modifier. Talismans instead make the Ascendant's unarmed strikes and grapples Sorcerous.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Mind Made Manifest**
| When the Ascendant makes an opposed Insight check either as part of an Arcanum or ability, or to resist an Arcanum or ability, they may dedicate Magic to that check as additional dice.
|
| **Natural Selection**
| When the Ascendant successfully damages at least one character with an Arcanum, they gain 1 Magic.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Spell Splicing**
| When attuning Arcana, the Ascendant may splice two Arcana together into one, merging their Difficulty. The second Arcanum's effect is additionally carried by the first, in a way determined by the GM if needed. If the delivery Arcanum has an AoE, the total Difficulty increases by 1. The triggered Arcanum's Path is considered as the delivery Arcanum's Path. Two AoE Arcana cannot be spliced together.
|
| **Thin the Veil**
| When the Ascendant casts an area of effect Arcanum that would originate from the Ascendant's square in a line, cone, or burst, they may instead have it originate from anywhere within the Arcanum's ordinary range. Arcana cast this way retain the same direction in which they were cast originally.
