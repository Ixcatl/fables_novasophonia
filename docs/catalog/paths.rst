.. Note::
  "Secondary Path prefix" refers to either a character's second highest rank Path or their second oldest Path, and may be applied as a prefix to their primary Path title purely for flavor. Design a Noble Duelist, or a Crooked Champion!

Ascendant
-----
  *All living things, willfully or not, are destined to rise above one another; thus is the way of nature. Is it not simply natural, then, to seek the truest final Ascension, learning from the folly of those who came before?*

Secondary Path prefix: "Eminent"

Rank 1
~~~~~~
| **Astral Conduit**
| The Ascendant may pour some of their Magic into an ordinary object, transforming it into an Astral Conduit. The Conduit can store a maximum amount of Magic points equal to its creator's Ascendant rank. They may have only one Astral Conduit, and creating a new one destroys the old one. While holding a Conduit or carrying it on the Belt, the Ascendant or another character with Ascendant ranks may spend 1 Stamina to draw any amount of Magic from it. As a Focus action, the Ascendant can either deposit any amount of Magic into their existing Conduit, or create a new one.
|
| **Sorcerous Casting**
| The Ascendant may treat all arcane foci as weapons with the Sorcerous modifier. Talismans instead make the Ascendant's unarmed strikes and grapples Sorcerous.

Rank 2
~~~~~~
| **Mind Made Manifest**
| When the Ascendant makes an opposed Insight check either as part of an Arcana or ability, or to resist an Arcana or ability, they may dedicate Magic dice to that check.
|
| **Unnatural Selection**
| When the Ascendant damages at least one character with an Arcana, the Ascendant gains 1 Magic.

Rank 3
~~~~~~
| **Spell Splicing**
| agga
|
| **Thin the Veil**
| When the Ascendant casts an area of effect Arcana that would originate from the Ascendant's square in a line, cone, or burst, they may instead have it originate from anywhere within the Arcana's range.
