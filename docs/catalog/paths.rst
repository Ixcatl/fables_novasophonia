  "Prefix" generally refers to either a character's second highest rank path or their second oldest path, and may be applied as a prefix to their primary path title purely for flavor if desired.

--------

Martial Paths
=============

--------

Duelist
------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Noble"*

    Duelists don't receive nearly as many specialized features as other paths, but what purpose they lack is compensated in general combat prowess.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Guard Breaker**
    | Your weapon attack rolls against the most recent enemy(s) you have successfully damaged with the same weapon gain +1 :term:`favor`.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Battle Stance**
    | When an enemy enters a square adjacent to you from a square not adjacent, they provoke an attack of opportunity.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Martial Master**
    | You may perform one additional weapon art per turn.

--------

Cavalier
-------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Spry"*

    A Cavalier's main strength is their speed. They seek to outmaneuver their opponents, waiting until the time is right to strike back in force, taking full advantage of the momentum they've gathered.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1
      
    | **Lancing Strikes**
    | You may attack with melee weapons using Grace to hit instead of Might, but not with heavy weapons. Lance-type weapons are an exception to this limit.

    | **Sharp Lunge**
    | You may accept a -1 die penalty on your attack roll for any melee or thrown attack to increase the range of the attack by 1. This is treated as a free dash, and enhanced by dash distance increases.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Battle Rhythm**
    | During combat, when you take a dash or jump action, move while dodging, or use an ability that moves yourself, you gain 1 stack of Momentum. After initiating an attack or dodge action with Stamina, you may dedicate stacks of Momentum as if they were additional Stamina.
    | Momentum can be stored up to a maximum of your Cavalier rank, and stacks fade at the end of your next turn after they are gained.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Untouchable**
    | 6s rolled on dodge attempts are treated as two successes. When you move while dodging, you do not gain a stack of Off-Balance.

--------

Warrior
-------

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  .. div:: sd-mb-1

    Placeholder

  .. div:: sd-text-right

    -- placeholder person

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Ruthless"*

    Through consistent, overwhelming force does a Warrior best their opponents. Their techniques allow them to keep delivering deadly blows where others would have long since faltered.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Power Attack**
    | Any time you dedicate at least 3 Stamina to an attack or weapon art, it gains +1 base damage. This bonus is increased to +2 if the attack is made with a heavy weapon or club-type weapon. If performing an attack or art with an area of effect or multiple attacks, you must spend an additional 1 taxed Stamina to make it a power attack.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Second Wind**
    | Any time you end your turn with 0 Stamina, you regain 1 Stamina.

    | **Uproot**
    | You may attack an empty square with your weapon at 1 Stamina cost, creating :term:`rough terrain`. Creatures burrowed within the terrain at the time take 2 blunt damage and are forced to surface.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Law of Conservation**
    | Taxed Stamina spent on an attack counts as dedicated Stamina for you, increasing the number of dice rolled as usual. When spending Stamina to remove stacks of Off-Balance, your next attack within the same turn receives the same amount of Stamina as was spent dedicated for free.

--------

Rogue
---------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Cunning"*

    Rogues excel in manipulating the battlefield, setting a wide variety of traps and playing opponents directly into their schemes.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Swift Strikes**
    | You may attack with melee weapons using Grace to hit instead of Might, but not with heavy weapons.

    | **Push and Pull**
    | When you successfully risk damage with an attack, you may choose to risk 1 less damage. If you do, you may move the struck target one square in any direction, or two if using a heavy weapon.

    | *You learn two trap blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Hair Trigger**
    | You may deploy traps at a range of 3. When you set a trap, it can be given a more sensitive trigger, expanding its activation squares to the squares adjacent. A single target trap will target the creature that triggered it, while those with an area of effect will still originate from the trap itself.

    | *You learn another trap blueprint of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Fighting Dirty**
    | After successfully dealing damage to a target, or affecting them with any kind of flask or trap, you may use dirty tactics to inflict a status effect which lowers any one of the target's primary attributes by 1, or their Speed by 2. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

    | *You learn another trap blueprint of any rarity.*

--------

Berserker
-------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Wrathful"*

    The life of a Berserker is often short, but a fighter without regard for their own safety is the most dangerous of all. The Berserker's brutal advance taxes the body and soul.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Adrenaline Rush**
    | When you are at 4-5 Vitality, you gain 1 DR. When at 3 Vitality or below, or when at Death's Door, you gain 2 DR.

    | **Burnout**
    | When making an attack, parrying, or dodging, you may dedicate Vitality in place of Stamina, as long as at least 1 Stamina has already been dedicated to the action.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Onslaught**
    | After you make an attack and your target has made a defense roll (if any), you may choose to reroll a number of failures up to twice your Berserker rank. If you do, roll a d6. If the result is less than your current Vitality, you suffer 2 :term:`true damage <damage type: true>`.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Bloodbath**
    | Slaying an enemy restores 1 Vitality. If the killing blow was made using a natural melee weapon, 2 Vitality is restored instead.

--------

Champion
------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Stalwart"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Glancing Blows**
    | If an attack you attempt to parry still risks damage after the attempt, you gain +1 :term:`favor` for your soak roll against it.

    | **Watchful Eye**
    | The first attack of opportunity you make each round costs no Stamina to initiate.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Withstand**
    | Whenever you take soakable damage during a round, you gain +1 bonus die when soaking further damage. This effect stacks indefinitely and resets at the start of your next turn.

    | **Force of Will**
    | When you take a focus action to restore Vitality, you may instead choose to restore Durability to your worn armor in lieu of Vitality.
    | In addition, while taking any focus action, you increase your effective Mettle score by 2 until no longer focusing.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Impassable**
    | Squares adjacent to you count as :term:`rough terrain` against trespassers. Flying or Leaping creatures crossing over these squares (using your melee weapon's range upwards) are forced to land, though this does not end their turn.

    | **Martial Defense**
    | You may use normal weapon arts as attacks of opportunity or activate an augmentation art during an attack of opportunity, bypassing the arts per turn limit.

--------

Ranger
------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Deft"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Heavy Shot**
    | At any time during your turn, you may add 1 Stamina tax to further ranged or thrown attacks on your turn to gain +1 favor with them. This bonus does not stack.

    | **Quick Nock**
    | The second non-paired ranged or thrown attack you make in a turn ignores 1 Stamina tax.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Rebound**
    | Once per round, should your thrown or ranged attack be dodged or parried, it can ricochet to a target adjacent to the first. The ricocheted attack inherits the same number of successes as the original, and is otherwise functionally identical. If the original target was adjacent to a wall, the ricochet may instead target them a second time. An attack cannot ricochet more than once.

    | **???**
    | You do not trigger attacks of opportunity when making ranged or thrown attacks.
    | TODO?

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

--------

Arbalist
--------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Deadeye"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Good Arm**
    | You may attack with ranged weapons using Might to hit instead of Grace.

    | **Long Shot**
    | When you make a ranged or spell attack, its range can be surpassed by up to twice its original. Each square beyond its original range inflicts a -1 die penalty on the attack roll.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Zero In**
    | At the end of your turn, you may choose a target square to focus your sights on. At the end of your turns thereafter, including this one, you gain 1 stack of Aim - allowing you to ignore 2 die penalties from Long Shot against any targets in that square - which stacks up to 2. This is treated as a concentration effect; any spending of Stamina or Anima that does not affect your target square removes 1 Aim. During your turn, you may also spend 1 Aim to move the target square 2 squares in any direction, or choose a new square, which resets all Aim.
    | If the target square is within your normal range, you gain +1 die to ranged or spell attack rolls against any targets in that square, as long as you have at least one stack of Aim.

    | **Overwatch**
    | You can make an attack of opportunity with a ranged or thrown weapon against any creature entering or exiting Zero In's target square. However, creatures can make a tactics- or perception-adjacent skill check to determine where you are currently aiming.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Bullseye**
    | 6s rolled when you make a ranged attack are treated as 2 successes.

    | **Target Sweep**
    | Squares adjacent to Zero In's target square also receive its bonuses, but are treated as if having -1 stack of Aim.

--------

Bombardier
---------

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Volatile"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Set Dressing**
    | When you make a thrown or natural ranged attack that will not directly impact a creature or affect an occupied square, the attack is unaffected by Stamina tax, and does not increase it. You may also pair thrown flasks with any weapon.

    | *You learn three flask blueprints of common or uncommon rarity.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Controlled Environment**
    | When you throw a flask, you may increase its terrain effect radius by one, targeted effects instead being applied as a Burst(1) AoE. Flasks thrown can ignore a number of allies or squares within their effect radius up to your Bombardier rank.
    | Areas of effect from natural ranged weapons or hand pumps may also have their size increased by 1, and ignore a number of allies or squares up to your Bombardier Rank.

    | **Efficient Reagents**
    | When crafting a flask, potion, or poison, roll a d6. On a success, up to 25 value in materials used may be refunded.

    | *You learn another two new common or uncommon flask blueprints.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Chemical Admixture**
    | While in possession of two non-rare flasks, you may combine them at any time. Choose one flask to be the "carrier" and another to be the "payload". Natural ranged weapons may act as a carrier.
    | Choose one of the payload's targeted or terrain effects. If the effect is targeted, it applies to all creatures the carrier's effects apply to. If the effect is terrain, it applies to all tiles the carrier applies to, or the tiles of creatures the carrier affects.

    | *You learn another two new flask blueprints of any rarity.*

Mystic Paths
============

--------

Arcanist
-----

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  <blurb>

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Arcane"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Astral Conduit**
    | You may pour some of your Anima into an ordinary object, ossifying it and transforming it into an *astral conduit*. The conduit can store a maximum amount of Anima equal to your Arcanist rank. You may have only one astral conduit, and creating a new one destroys the old. While holding a conduit or carrying it on the Belt, you or a friendly adjacent character with Arcanist ranks may spend 1 Stamina to draw any amount of Anima from it. As a focus action, you can deposit any amount of Anima into your existing conduit, or create a new one.

    | **Sorcerous Casting**
    | You may treat your attuned arcane focus as a weapon with the Sorcerous modifier, if it can be used as one. Talismans instead make your unarmed attacks and grapples Sorcerous.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Mind Over Matter**
    | When you make an opposed Insight check either as part of a spell or ability, or to resist a spell or ability, you may dedicate Anima to that check as bonus dice.

    | **Prudent Research**
    | When performing research to learn a new spell, if you have access to a grimoire containing the spell, two failed dice on your research roll instead count as successes.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    

--------

Thaumaturge
---------

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  Any astronomer worth their salt regards Pandemonium as one of the most potent sources of magic in the Corporeum, but reining it in is another matter of miracle-making entirely.

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Thaumetic"*

    Thaumaturges derive strength from obscure geometry and sigils, granting powerful command over their magicks with good positioning and some luck.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Sacred Geometry**
    | As a focus action costing 1 Stamina and 1 Anima, you may etch a ritual shape into the square beneath you. For larger characters, these *ley lines* encompass squares equal to your body size, and only function when standing within all of them. Your ley lines are unique to you and cannot be used by others; furthermore, you may only have one set of ley lines at a time. They do not have a set duration, but can be disrupted or destroyed by effects that create rough terrain.
    | While standing within your ley lines, you may choose to cast any spell as a focus action instead. When the focus resolves and the spell is cast, roll a number of dice equal to your ranks in the path used to cast the spell, or the spell's cost - 1, whichever is lower. You restore Anima equal to the successes of this roll.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Funneled Spells**
    | You gain 1 Anima when you deal direct damage to one or more creatures with a spell. This effect may trigger only once per spell.

    | **Spatial Anchor**
    | While standing within your ley lines, you may choose to Anchor yourself in place during your turn. While Anchored, you cannot move and only replenish 3 Speed per turn, but you may use Insight on any roll to resist forced movement. Any forced movement received costs Speed instead of moving you, as if you had moved the same number of squares. Movement exceeding your Speed moves you as normal and breaks your Anchor.
    | You may manually break your Anchor during your turn, but doing so reduces your remaining Speed to 2.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Controlled Chaos**
    | When attuning spells, you may combine two spells into one *chimeric spell*, merging their difficulty at a minimum of 2. The second spell's effect is additionally carried by the first, in a way arbitrated by the GM if necessary.
    | The second spell's path is considered the same as the first, but the chimeric spell's maximum casting difficulty is limited by the lower of the two. If the first spell has an AoE, the total difficulty increases by 1; two AoE spells cannot be spliced together. As a rule of thumb, the damage/healing, duration, and unique effects of both component spells are modified individually; all other modifiers may be applied to the chimeric spell itself.

    | **Astral Projection**
    | When you cast a spell with an AoE that would originate from your square, you may instead have it originate from any square within its initial area of effect. Spells cast this way retain the same direction and range with which they were cast originally.

    | **Font of Power**
    | While standing within your ley lines, if you cast a Thaumaturge spell of 4 difficulty or greater, you receive 1 difficulty in free modification for that spell. Additionally, any chimeric spells you cast as a focus action within your ley lines count as 2 path ranks higher for the sake of restoring Anima through Sacred Geometry.

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "Verdant"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Lay on Hands**
    | When you take a focus action to restore Vitality, you may instead choose a living creature within 3 squares to receive it. If your target leaves this radius at any point before the action resolves, it fails.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Triage**
    | When you take a focus action to restore Vitality to others as part of Lay on Hands, every 2 Anima spent grants a guaranteed success instead of every third.

Conjurer
-----

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    *Prefix: "???"*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Corpus Collector**
    | You gain access to a personal bestiary of creatures and a unique spell used to recreate any one of them, with varying costs.
    | To fill your bestiary, you must either find detailed research on a creature in question or study it in the flesh. As a camp action, you can make a research roll with difficulty equal to twice the creature's Conjury slot cost, with live and conscious subjects adding 2 flat successes after your roll. Similar to normal research, your progress towards a given bestiary entry can be continued over multiple rests.

    | *You learn how to conjure a 1 Conjury slot creature of your choice.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Wills Entwined**
    | Once per round per conjuration, if it damages a target in melee, roll a number of dice equal to its Conjury slot cost. With 1 success, the conjuration receives 1 Anima as normal from the attack; if its Anima is full, you receive it instead, as long as the conjuration is within Sense range.

    | **Undying Spectres**
    | Any time one of your conjurations in Sense range would perish at 0 Vitality or Anima, you may immediately spend 1 Anima yourself to restore it with 1 Vitality and 1 Anima.

    | *You gain 1 Conjury slot, and learn how to conjure an additional creature up to 2 slots in cost.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **Simulacrum**
    | You may choose to give any conjuration you create a lifelike patina, passing as a normal creature without most of the hallmarks of a conjuration. Identifying a *simulacrum* for what it is requires an Insight check at a difficulty of 3.
    | The simulacrum also gains a simple personality, typically controlled by the GM but still heeding all commands as normal. If not under your immediate control, it may act as it sees fit even outside of Sense range, as an ordinary and naive living being with undying fealty towards you.

    | **Conceptual Embodiment**
    | When conjuring a creature within Touch range, you may choose to shunt yourself into its form, taking full control of it as an *embodiment*. You replace all senses and control over your original body with those of the embodiment. This lasts until it perishes, runs its duration, or is dispelled.
    | The embodiment inherits your Insight, current Anima, speech, knowledge, mental traits, spells, arts, paths, and proficiencies in place of its own. You otherwise become the creature for all intents and purposes, including its attributes and physical traits. Its Anima is linked with your original body, and any gains/costs are shared accordingly; when attacking foes in melee with the embodiment, you receive Anima as per normal rules instead. When restored through Undying Spectres, the embodiment's Vitality is set to 1 as normal, but your Anima remains the same minus the initial cost of the ability.

    | *You gain 1 Conjury slot, and learn how to conjure an additional creature up to 3 slots in cost.*

Novel Paths
============
These paths are unique in one or more ways, owing to complex mechanics, gimmicks with drawbacks, or more important story hooks. They still count as either martial or mystic, but are separated nonetheless for their more nuanced gameplay ramifications.

Abomination
-----

.. card::
  :shadow: none
  :class-card: sd-mx-4 sd-text-muted sd-font-italic sd-rounded-3
  :class-body: sd-py-2

  <blurb>

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    | *Martial*
    | *Prefix: "Subsumed"*

    *Typically only available to creatures partially altered by the Apitekt, such as amalgams.*

    Heavily inspired by the Path of Monsters from Shards of Chaos. TBD

  .. tab-item:: Amalgam (TO BE EXPANDED/MOVED)

    Amalgams are a sub-race of creatures infested by the true Apitekt, not fully subsumed but with traits imprinted upon them, for better or worse. Visible changes can vary wildly as the individual's infestation worsens.

    | **Alien Body**
    | Reduces most outside attempts to heal you by 1 success and causes drugs to be unpredictable. When ingesting a drug or potion not specifically made to compensate, roll one die. 1-2 causes no effect; 3-4 causes its normal effect; 5-6 doubles its effect as if using a second copy of that item, including strain.
    
    (TBD POSITIVE TRAIT, GUH)

  .. tab-item:: Mutations (TO BE MOVED)

    | Mutations are treated as special traits, distinguished as *positive* or *negative*. For technicality's sake, all mutations have -5 or +5 value respectively. For every mutation on a creature up to a maximum of 5, they trade -1 Charm for +1 Fright. Any maximum pool increases do not increase the target's current pool values.
    | They take the same flavor as the Apitekt themselves, affected body parts often becoming sludgy, branching, or clay-like; unique to each individual.

    .. warning::
      (there might be some references to traits/mechanics that do not exist yet, sorry for any confusion i'm still writing stuff!!!!)

    .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Positive

        | **Adaptation**
        | You gain +1 to one primary attribute. May be stacked twice, but doing so penalizes -1 from another primary attribute.

        | **Jittering Haste**
        | You gain +2 bonus dice to initiative and +1 maximum Stamina. Should this surpass the normal stamina cap, you gain +1 Speed instead.

        | **Pulsating Growths**
        | You gain +1 maximum Vitality and +1 extra Fright, as these vital growths undulate and glow unnervingly.

        | **Hunchback**
        | You gain +3 Load. *May be stacked twice.*

        | **Porcelain Visage**
        | Your body takes a dignified but still unnatural form. You gain +2 Charm and +2 Fright instead of the usual mutation offset.

        | **Bioweapon**
        | You gain one normal natural weapon trait and any desired subtraits for it, up to -5 in trait value. If the mutation is not temporary, the natural weapon can be modified as normal. If the weapon(s) occupy the arms, you may instead sprout new limbs with the sole purpose of bearing them.

        | **Soul Sight**
        | Your body is dotted with beady glowing eyes, enabling you to see the flow of Anima. You gain Lifesense (6), and may roll an Insight check when discerning a living creature with it, each success revealing one of their mystic path ranks if any. Mystic ranks you share with them are identified for free. Any extra successes may detect a number of martial path ranks, with no more information beyond that.
        | The glowing eyes are very easy to spot in darkness unless they are closed, which disables Soul Sight's benefits.

        | **Gravitational Flux**
        | You perpetually levitate up to 1 square off the ground. You do not trigger ground-based trap triggers or take fall damage, and you glide over ground-based terrain effects, including bodies of liquid. Moving upward costs Speed as normal, and you may choose to fall downward at 3 squares per turn instead of the standard 10.
        | If stacked a second time, objects in your immediate viscinity gravitate to you. Up to 2 Bulk of items in the same square(s) as you act as if stored on the Belt and wielded in the hands simultaneously. A creature can attempt to grab one of the items, making an opposed Grace check against your Insight. Paired attacks made with weapons wielded this way cost an additional 1 Anima.

        | **Gangly Limbs**
        | Any held melee weapons have +1 range and count as reach, and your area threatened for attacks of opportunity has a range of 2. However, your Might is reduced by 1. These effects may instead be applied to one melee natural weapon trait you own, replacing the Might reduction with a -1 die penalty to hit using it.
        | *May be stacked if you still have natural weapons to modify. Incompatible without arms or a melee natural weapon.*

        | **Impenetrable**
        | You gain immunity to Bleeding and 1 DR against physical damage, as your flesh immediately closes any surface wounds.

        | **Brainwash**
        | Any creature that successfully damages you with a bite, or otherwise consumes your flesh and blood, must make an Insight check with successes equal to your Abomination rank or else fall under your spell. Until the next rest, you score an automatic 2 successes on any social checks against that creature. You gain Brainwash as poison and targeted flask blueprints, which you can create at the cost of 1 Vitality. If you gain Brainwash through a temporary mutation, should you lose it at any point, these items immediately become useless.
        | *Incompatible if you have no Abomination ranks. If you gain a natural weapon trait, such as from Bioweapon, you can use Brainwash as its poison/flask effect if it has one.*

        | **Anima Reaver**
        | You gain a modified version of the Hemophage trait. Replacing its normal Belly effects, you instead siphon 1 Anima from your victim if they have any, transferring it from them to you. 
        | Using a focus action, you can also attempt an Insight check with 3 successes to draw 1 Anima from the corpse of an intelligent being in Touch range, once per corpse, regardless of how long ago they have died. This additionally gleans one very vague, hazy memory from the deceased.

        | **Taste for Flesh**
        | You gain the Devourer (Vitality) trait, which also replenishes 5 Belly every time it triggers, but *consumption* is now a key word for your Ambitions, if you have them.

        | **Morphology**
        | (WIP) You gain the ability to cast <TRAIT-GIVING SPELL NAME> with no modification, or shapeshift into any playable species, incurring 1 Mettle damage from either process. Both effects last until your next rest; changing species will dispel the effect of <TRAIT-GIVING SPELL NAME>, requiring an additional cast.
        | When shapeshifting, you may take nearly any appearance you desire, including that of another character should their appearance be within Sense range; however, if Morphology is gained through Metamorphosis, you may only use the core body plan of your target species, retaining your overall monstrous appearance. You replace your starting attributes and traits (excluding mental) with those of your target species, keeping all bonuses allocated from levels and otherwise. You may also freely select a subspecies, but you must choose the Amalgam alteration.
        | Losing this mutation at any point immediately reverts you to your original species and dispels the effect of <TRAIT-GIVING SPELL NAME>. You may only cast <TRAIT-GIVING SPELL NAME> or shapeshift once per turn.

        | **Rejection**
        | One primary attribute is reduced by -1.5. *Incompatible if the attribute would be reduced below 1.*

        | **Crackling Ligaments**
        | You suffer a -2 die penalty to initiative and -1 maximum Stamina.

        | **Feral Sepsis**
        | You suffer -1 maximum Vitality and a -1 die penalty to all Ambitions checks.

        | **Lumbering Gait**
        | You suffer -2 Speed.

        | **Feeble Visage**
        | Your body twists into a rather pathetic appearance. You lose -2 Charm and -2 Fright instead of the usual mutation offset.

        | **Fused Arms**
        | One half of your arms rounded up are rendered lame, fused to your body, or outright missing, and can no longer hold objects or perform tasks as normal.
        | *May be stacked twice to remove all arms. Does not affect any limbs gained through temporary effects.*

        | **Otherworldly Echoes**
        | Your mind parses the world differently and struggles to comprehend it. When starting a new scene, make an Insight check requiring two successes; failure inflicts 1 Insight damage.
        | *Can be stacked more than once through temporary mutations. If gained through Metamorphosis, it applies even while not transformed. If gained through a temporary mutation, it immediately deals 1 Insight damage alongside its normal effects.*

        | **Insatiable**
        | You have +10 Hunger, and *consumption* is now a key word for your Ambitions, if you have them.
        | *Can be stacked more than once through temporary mutations. If gained through Metamorphosis, it applies even while not transformed. If gained through a temporary mutation, it immediately reduces Belly by 10 alongside its normal effects.*

        | **Nullifying Tumors**
        | One positive mutation from Metamorphosis or The Burgeoning is negated.
        | *Can be stacked as long as you have positive mutations. If gained through a temporary mutation, your newest positive mutation is negated instead.*

  .. tab-item:: Rank 1

    | **Ersatz Recovery**
    | Using 1 Stamina, you may accept a negative mutation you know to restore 1 Vitality. Mutations gained this way cannot normally be removed except by spending 1 Stamina and 1 Vitality to do so. You can use this ability twice per turn; once to add a mutation, and once to remove a mutation.
    | You instinctively know a number of negative mutations equal to twice your Abomination rank.

    | **Ambitions**
    | Primal Apitekt impulsivity begins to manifest within you. Discuss with your GM your most selfish motivations in a single key word. When overtly resisting these motivations, you must perform an Insight check (known furthermore as an "Ambitions check", the successes required generally higher if the task is not risky) or else be overcome with a frenzied desire to pursue the act to its completion. This Urge acts as a Berserk-adjacent effect, during which every action you take must be in the direct pursuit of your ambitions. Every second round thereafter, you may make another Ambitions check with the same difficulty, snapping out of the Urge if passed. Skills based on restraint may potentially apply to Ambitions checks.
    | Ambitions are heavily personalized. A warrior craving *slaughter* might kill a helpless opponent they would have otherwise mercied; a thief presented with *riches* may fill their pockets at an inopportune time; a wizard yearning for *knowledge* could lose themselves in a library for hours. Key words gained from mutations may stack, but generally increase the difficulty of their Ambitions checks in doing so.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 2

    | **Sculptor of Sinew**
    | At the cost of 1 Stamina and 1 Vitality, you can grant a positive mutation you know to a target within Touch range as an ordinary 3 point status effect, including yourself. This ability can be used only once per turn.
    | You instinctively know a number of positive mutations equal to twice your Abomination rank.

    | **Metamorphosis**
    | As a focus action, your body drastically morphs into a pseudo-Apitekt, developing associated boons and maluses. While transformed, you keep all of your qualities except for your senses, and gain Amorphous, Tremorsense, and 2 Absorption, but also a Weakness trait to one elemental damage type of your choosing. Any equipped armor does not grant its defensive values; any other equipment remains the same, though it may not be visible in your transformed state. You must select 2 of your positive mutations and 1 negative mutation to exhibit while transformed; these choices are immutable.

    | **Ambitions II**
    | Your ambitions distort to an insidious degree as Apitekt instincts invade your thoughts. You gain a second key word to abide by, and your Urges are twisted by otherworldly nourishment; warriors feast on their foes, thieves consume their spoils, and wizards literally absorb knowledge. Furthermore, you forcefully undergo Metamorphosis for the duration of the Urge, including the focus action, which cannot be interrupted as normal.
    | Due to all of the above, actions made while under an Urge's thrall generally take only half as much time. Should you allow the Urge to follow through to its completion, you may also learn, gain, or absorb something useful from the experience, at the GM's behest.

  .. tab-item:: Rank 3

    | **The Burgeoning**
    | You evolve further, but can no longer reliably hide your nature. You permanently gain one positive mutation and one negative mutation, both of which persist between your forms.
    | Once only, you may freely replace your preset mutations in Metamorphosis or The Burgeoning with others you know. The replacement mutation must remain positive or negative. Once per rest, you may do this again, but with only one mutation at a time.

    | **Imperfect Propagation**
    | When you hit a creature with any natural weapon or are struck by a natural melee weapon, you may inflict the creature with a negative mutation you know as an ordinary 2 point status effect. Additionally, you may use the senses of any creatures affected by your temporary mutations as if you were them.

    | **Ambitions III**
    | You learn to harness your waxing hunger with frightening strength. You gain a third key word to abide by, but any attacks, soaks, or checks to resist magical effects made during an Urge gain +1 reroll. Your Ambitions checks always have +1 reroll, even when unaffected by an Urge.

  .. tab-item:: Summary

    | *Mystic*
    | *Prefix: "Pious"*

    *Typically only available to characters who revere a specific deity, especially those willing to do its bidding.*

    The Apostle chooses a deity from a wide list of *charitable, cryptic, or cruel* figures. Unlike other mystic paths, the Apostle's list of learnable spells hinges entirely on each individual deity, as they feature their own spell lists. The Apostle has unique rank traits which may affect certain spells with a *faith modifier*, or change damage types to holy. Doing things aligning with your deity grants +1, while angering them costs -1. This resets every rest. Maybe add Apostle-unique spells for each deity as well, in much smaller numbers?
