UWR features a dice pool mechanic at its core, using d6s almost exclusively. Each player will want about eight six-sided dice, though even more may be
necessary in some cases.

A lot of actions may require a check to count successes by rolling with d6s. Each die that rolls a 5 or above succeeds, while (normally) anything below
fails and is not counted. Checks between two characters may pit these rolls against one another; others will require a static target of winning dice to
succeed. The number of dice to be rolled and the target number of successes can vary drastically in each situation.

Rerolls
=======

When making a check, a character may have access to a certain number of rerolls. Immediately after a roll is made, the player making that roll may
choose a failed die for each allowed reroll, and roll them again. The better of the two outcomes is then used.

Favor
=====

Under most circumstances, rolls will require a 5 or above to succeed for that check. However, for certain exceptionally easy checks, they may favor
towards the lower end. A roll with +1 favor, for instance, will have a success range of 4+ instead of 5+, making it substantially easier to pass.
