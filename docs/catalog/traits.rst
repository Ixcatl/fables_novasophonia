Natural Weapons
===============

Sharp Claws
-----------
This pawn's extremities end in claws, with 1 base damage.

On hands, the claws apply no penalty to dextrous actions, but require a free hand to use. They can be paired with any other weapon, and when a sharp claw strikes as a paired attack, its base damage increases by 1.

On feet, the claws may be used as long as no footwear obstructs them, but they cannot be paired.

Mystical Traits

Anima Shivers
---------
This pawn always knows when they are in the presence of powerful magic. At GM discretion, they may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.

Manapot
-------
When taking a Rest and regaining Anima, this pawn may store excess Anima points up to their Savvy score in a separate "pool". Using 1 Stamina, they may return all of these points to their Anima pool, losing any which exceed their maximum Anima.

Wick Magic
-------------
This pawn may spend one Anima when they are affected by an instance of astral damage to attempt a Soak roll against that damage. If they possess an Absorption score, they may use it instead of Mettle on the roll.

--------

Body Traits
===========

Contortionist
-------------
This pawn's body is thin, bendy, or amorphous. They can squeeze into smaller spaces as usual without penalties, though they still block the movement of others.

Extra Arms
----------
This pawn has an additional pair of arms, with equal function as any others.

Scars

Lost Tail
---------
Once owning a tail, this pawn is now bereft of it. They suffer a -1 :term:`die penalty` on any Grace checks involving acrobatics or similar.
