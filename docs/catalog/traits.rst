Character Traits
================

Desperado
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| When at 1 Vitality or below, this pawn's Speed increases by 2, and they gain +2 dice towards Soak rolls.

Soulmates
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| *Must be taken by two characters simultaneously.*
| These two are bonded by fates intertwined. Be it as lovers, rivals, comrades, or nemeses, they will always find their way back to each other.
| The paired characters have a combined Anima pool shared between the both of them, though one may deny the other from accessing their portion of the pool. The Soulmates feel an instinctive pull in the direction of their counterpart.

Team Tactics
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-2``
| This pawn gets +1 bonus die to hit a target that has been hit by an ally since their last turn.
| Additionally, they gain +1 reroll to relevant rolls when crafting or performing a profession alongside another pawn doing the same task.

Overweight
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``0``
| This pawn is remarkably chubby. They have +1 Bulk and -1 Speed, but also gain +0.5 Mettle.

Minor Flaw
--------
| *Physical/Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``+1``
| This pawn has a small personal weakness, giving them a -1 :term:`die penalty` for a particular use of a skill or attribute. Minor Flaw may be taken multiple times (and can stack on itself up to a -3 penalty), and can count as either a *physical* or *mental* trait.

.. Tip::
  | This is an extremely malleable trait and is meant to be personal for each character. If you are a player, speak with your GM about designing your own flaws. Simple examples may include:
  | **Scatterbrained**: *Mental.* -1 to lore checks.
  | **Sheepish**: *Mental.* -1 to opposed social checks.
  | **Lost tail**: *Physical.* -1 to acrobatics checks.
  | **Missing eye**: *Physical.* -1 to any checks relying on sight. +0.5 Fright.
  | **Compliant**: *Mental.* -1 to any check made against authority. +0.5 Charm.

--------

Natural Weapons
===============

Sharp Claws
-----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| This pawn's extremities end in claws, with 1 base damage.
| On hands, the claws apply no penalty to dextrous actions, but require a free hand to use. They can be paired with any other weapon, and when a sharp claw strikes as a paired attack, its base damage increases by 1.
| On feet, the claws may be used as long as no footwear obstructs them, but they cannot be paired.

--------

Mystical Traits
===============

Anima Shivers
---------
This pawn always knows when they are in the presence of powerful magic or forces of will. At GM discretion, they may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.

Manapot
-------
When taking a Rest and regaining Anima, this pawn may store excess Anima points up to their Savvy score in a separate "pool". Using 1 Stamina, they may return all of these points to their Anima pool, losing any which exceed their maximum Anima.

Shifting Guise
-------------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| This pawn has innate access to a modified version of the Disguise spell. This spell does not need to be attuned, has a duration of Lifetime, and can be cast without cost, but can only be cast with a range of Self and does not benefit from its normal Essence feature.

Wick Magic
-------------
This pawn may spend one Anima when they are affected by an instance of astral damage to attempt a Soak roll against that damage. If they possess an Absorption score, they may use it instead of Mettle on the roll.

--------

Body Traits
===========

Contortionist
-------------
This pawn's body is thin, bendy, or amorphous. They can squeeze into smaller spaces as usual without penalties, though they still block the movement of others.

Extra Arms
----------
This pawn has an additional pair of arms, with equal function as any others.
