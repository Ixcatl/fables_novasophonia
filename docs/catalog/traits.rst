Manapot
-------
When taking a Rest and regaining Magic, this character may store excess Magic points up to their Savvy score in a separate "pool". Using 1 Stamina, they may return all of these points to their Magic pool, losing any which exceed their maximum Magic.

Wick Magic
-------------
This character may spend one Magic when they are affected by an instance of magic damage to attempt a Soak roll against the damage. If they possess an Absorption score, they may use that value instead of Mettle on the roll.

Ear to the Wall
---------
This character always knows when they are in the presence of aberrations or powerful magic. At GM discretion, they may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.
