Natural Weapons
===============

Sharp Claws
-----------
This character's extremities end in claws, with 1 base damage.

On hands, the claws apply no penalty to dextrous actions, but require a free hand to use. They can be paired with any weapon, and when a sharp claw strikes as a paired attack, its base damage increases by 1.

On feet, the claws may be used as long as no footwear obstructs them, but they cannot be paired.

Mystical Traits
===============

Ear to the Wall
---------
This character always knows when they are in the presence of aberrations or powerful magic. At GM discretion, they may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.

Manapot
-------
When taking a Rest and regaining Magic, this character may store excess Magic points up to their Savvy score in a separate "pool". Using 1 Stamina, they may return all of these points to their Magic pool, losing any which exceed their maximum Magic.

Wick Magic
-------------
This character may spend one Magic when they are affected by an instance of magic damage to attempt a Soak roll against that damage. If they possess an Absorption score, they may use it instead of Mettle on the roll.

--------

Body Traits
===========

Contortionist
-------------
This character's body is thin, bendy, or amorphous. They can squeeze into smaller spaces as usual without penalties, though they still block the movement of others.

Extra Arms
----------
This character has an additional pair of arms, with equal function as any others.

Keen Ears
---------
This character has two reasonably large, sensitive ears.

Slender Tail
------------
This character possesses a long, thin tail. While it is essential for regulating body temperature and providing balance, it provides no outstanding benefits.

Lost Tail
---------
Once owning a tail, this character is now bereft of it. They suffer a -1 :term:`die penalty` on any Grace checks involving acrobatics or similar.
