Character Traits
================

Foible
--------
| *Physical/Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``+1``
This pawn has a small defect, giving them a -1 :term:`die penalty` for a particular use of a skill or attribute, or some other minor drawback. Foible may be taken multiple times, and can count as either a *physical* or *mental* trait.

.. Tip::
  | If you are a player, speak with your GM about designing your own Foibles. Examples may include:
  | **One-eyed**: *Physical.* -1 to checks relying on sight. +0.5 Fright.
  | **Lost tail**: *Physical.* -1 to acrobatics checks.
  | **Poor memory**: *Mental.* -1 to lore checks.

Natural Weapons
===============

Sharp Claws
-----------
| This pawn's extremities end in claws, with 1 base damage.
| On hands, the claws apply no penalty to dextrous actions, but require a free hand to use. They can be paired with any other weapon, and when a sharp claw strikes as a paired attack, its base damage increases by 1.
| On feet, the claws may be used as long as no footwear obstructs them, but they cannot be paired.

Mystical Traits
===============

Anima Shivers
---------
This pawn always knows when they are in the presence of powerful magic. At GM discretion, they may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.

Manapot
-------
When taking a Rest and regaining Anima, this pawn may store excess Anima points up to their Savvy score in a separate "pool". Using 1 Stamina, they may return all of these points to their Anima pool, losing any which exceed their maximum Anima.

Wick Magic
-------------
This pawn may spend one Anima when they are affected by an instance of astral damage to attempt a Soak roll against that damage. If they possess an Absorption score, they may use it instead of Mettle on the roll.

--------

Body Traits
===========

Contortionist
-------------
This pawn's body is thin, bendy, or amorphous. They can squeeze into smaller spaces as usual without penalties, though they still block the movement of others.

Extra Arms
----------
This pawn has an additional pair of arms, with equal function as any others.
