Character Traits
================

Trained Sense
----------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-4``
| Through discipline, instinct, or necessity, you have learned to use another sense beyond sight to its fullest potential. Choose Acute Scent or Tremorsense as a free subtrait.

Desperado
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| When at 1 Vitality or below, your Speed increases by 2, and you gain +2 dice towards Soak rolls.

Kindred
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| *Must be taken by two characters simultaneously.*
| You share a very similar soul with another individual, for better or worse, and are inextricably bound. You can draw from the Anima pools of one another at any time, though one may deny the other access.
| Kindred souls always feel an instinctive pull in the direction of their counterpart, though it is difficult to explain in detail.

Talent
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-2``
| You have a natural penchant for a particular skill. When using that skill to add dice to a roll, one of those dice is an automatic success instead of being rolled.
| This trait may be taken multiple times, but never for the same skill.

Team Tactics
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``-2``
| You get +1 die to hit a target that has been hit by an ally since your last turn.
| Additionally, you gain +1 reroll to relevant rolls when crafting or performing a profession alongside another doing the same task.

Vocalist
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| You've trained yourself to sing in a distinctive way, capable of being heard over long distances. When this trait is chosen, define your singing style as either *pleasant* or *haunting*. Treat your Charm or Fright, respectively, as 1 higher for interactions with others who have heard your performance in the current Scene.

Gaunt
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``0``
| You are abnormally thin. You lose -1 Belt slot, but also -1 Bulk.

Heavyset
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``0``
| You are exceptionally overweight. You have +1 Bulk and -1 Speed, but gain +1 Belt slot.

Minor Flaw
--------
| *Physical/Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``+1``
| You have a small personal weakness, typically giving -1 die towards a particular use of a skill or attribute. Minor Flaw may be taken multiple times (and can stack on itself up to a -3 penalty), and can count as either a physical or mental trait.

.. Tip::
  | This is an extremely malleable trait and is meant to be personal for each character. If you are a player, speak with your GM about designing your own flaws. Simple examples may include:
  | **Scatterbrained**: *Mental.* -1 to lore checks.
  | **Sheepish**: *Mental.* -1 to opposed social checks.
  | **Lost tail**: *Physical.* -1 to acrobatics checks.
  | **Missing eye**: *Physical.* -1 to any checks relying on sight. +0.5 Fright.
  | **Compliant**: *Mental.* -1 to any check made against perceived authority. +0.5 Charm.

One Arm
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``+4``
| You have one arm, and may only wield a single one-handed object.
| If you already have the Extra Arms trait, One Arm becomes **Missing Arm** and only grants +2 trait points, though it can stack on itself an additional two times for a total of +6 trait points.
| Cannot be taken with Armless.

Phobia
--------
| *Mental*
| *Trait value:* ``+4``
| You have a debilitating fear of something in particular. When faced with your fear, you must make an Insight check. The difficulty of this check is determined by the GM based on how commonly the feared object or concept is encountered and the severity of the current exposure.
| If you fail this check, you receive a -1 die penalty to all rolls other than Soak and may not willingly confront or approach the target of your fear. This lasts until you can no longer sense your fear and a number of rounds have passed equal to the number of successes by which you failed the Insight check.

Blind
--------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``+5``
| You completely lack the sense of sight, with all of the massive drawbacks that entails. You have Tremorsense with a range of 2.
| Trained Sense may be taken as a subtrait of Blind.

Vulnerability
----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``+6``
| You have a specific fatal flaw. Whenever you are dealt damage or otherwise affected by your vulnerability, you take 1 :term:`true damage <damage type: true>` immediately after.
| Vulnerabilities should feature a particular damage type - such as :term:`heat <damage type: heat>`, :term:`poison <damage type: poison>`, or :term:`blunt <damage type: blunt>` - or a particular allergen or status, as adjudicated by the GM.

Armless
----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``+10``
| You have no arms, and so cannot wield anything.
| Tasks relying on manual dexterity are immensely difficult for you. This difficulty can range from -1 to impossible, at GM discretion.

--------

Body Traits
===========

Contortionist
-------------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| Your body is thin, bendy, or amorphous. You can squeeze into smaller spaces as usual without penalties, though you still block the movement of others.

Extra Arms
----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-4``
| You have an additional pair of arms, with equal function as any others.

Resistant
----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-4``
| You are quite resistant to a specific type of damage. 
| Choose a damage type from the glossary, such as :term:`cold <damage type: cold>`, :term:`sharp <damage type: sharp>`, or :term:`holy <damage type: holy>`. Even if the damage is normally unsoakable, you receive + ``x`` extra dice that may be used to Soak it.
| If you suffer a negative status effect related to your resistance, you can roll ``x`` d6 to resist the status effect pool or duration, reducing it by the successes.
| If specified in a creature's rulebook entry, ``x`` is signified by the number given with the trait. Otherwise, ``x`` defaults to +4.

--------

Physiological Traits
===============

Firebox
----------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-4``
| You cannot subsist on any ordinary food; your diet is highly specialized and unusual.
| You gain a unique Charge pool with a maximum of 100.
| If this trait is *mystic*, your body is a machine that converts magical charge into metabolism.
| If this trait is *lapidary*, you live off the raw magical potential of gemstones.
| TBD TBD TBD

--------

Natural Weapons
===============

Sharp Claws
-----------
| *Physical*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| Your extremities end in claws, with 1 base damage.
| On hands, the claws apply no penalty to dextrous actions, but require a free hand to use. They can be paired with any other weapon, and when a sharp claw strikes as a paired attack, its base damage increases by 1.
| On feet, the claws may be used as long as no footwear obstructs them, but they cannot be paired.

--------

Mystical Traits
===============

Anima Shivers
---------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| You are capable of sensing the shifting dynamic of Astra and Anima, and always know when you are in the presence of powerful magic or wills. At GM discretion, you may have a vague idea of how powerful the source is on a successful Savvy check, but cannot pinpoint the source with this alone.

Manapot
-------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-2``
| When taking a Rest and regaining Anima, you may store excess Anima points up to your Savvy score in a temporary "pool". Using 1 Stamina, you may return all of these points to your Anima pool, losing any which exceed your maximum Anima.

Shifting Guise
-------------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-3``
| You have innate access to a modified version of the Disguise spell. This spell does not need to be attuned, has a duration of Lifetime, and can be cast without cost, but can only be cast with a range of Self and does not benefit from its normal Essence feature.

Wick Magic
-------------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-4``
| You may spend one Anima when you are affected by an instance of astral damage to attempt a Soak roll against that damage. If you possess an Absorption score, you may use it instead of Mettle on the roll.

--------

Planar Traits
===============

Fantasian Heredity
-----------
| *Physical, magic*
| *Trait value:* ``-1``
| You hail from the dreamlike world of Fantasia, featuring several of its innate qualities.
| TBD?
