Building Your Character
*********************

Before diving headfirst into this article, be sure to reference the core mechanics. From this point forward, it will be assumed that you have already done so.

To make a character of your own, you must first :doc:`choose a species </catalog/species>` to base them upon, using its associated Attributes, Pools, and Traits.

After your character's species and Feats have been chosen, the next step is to :doc:`choose what Paths </catalog/paths>` it has ranks in. A fresh character beginning their journey at Level 1 will typically begin with 1 rank in a Path of their choice, though at the GM's behest this may change. See Advancement & Levels for more information.
