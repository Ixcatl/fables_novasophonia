Spellcasting
**************
*Spells* are carefully-crafted methods through which one can wield latent magic. A prospective caster, drawing on their own Anima, uses the discipline of a specific spell to bring their wants into reality.

Preparing Spells
==========
Similar to weapon arts, while resting, you assign your spells to Technique slots for ease of use. Certain spells may require a choice or alteration to be made on preparation, changing their effects accordingly.

Casting & Aiming Spells
==========
Unless a spell specifies otherwise, only one may be cast per turn.

All spells have a certain *difficulty* score. To cast a spell, you must first spend Anima equal to its resulting difficulty, at a maximum equal to twice your ranks in the path used to cast it. If your spell targets a willing creature, there is no need to roll and the spell automatically succeeds. If your target is unwilling, or is an object wielded by an unwilling creature, the spell requires an attack roll unless otherwise specified.

| When casting a spell with a range of *touch*, its attack roll is based on Might or Insight, at your preference. If the spell is longer ranged, its attack roll is based on Grace or Insight instead. You then add your total number of ranks in mystic paths to the roll as bonus dice.
| If a spell calls for an opposed check with your target(s), it does not use the normal attack roll nor does it gain bonus dice from path ranks, unless the opposed check specifically calls for an attack roll.

A spell with an attack roll may be dodged, but not parried without special equipment.

Ritualized Spells
----------
*Ritualized spells* are more powerful, but take an exorbitant amount of time to prepare and cast. A spell cast in this manner may have a difficulty up to twice your total ranks in all mystic paths (as opposed to ranks only in the path used to cast the spell), but for every 1 difficulty, it takes 10 rounds to cast. This is treated as a long-term focus action, and you can ritualize any spell you know even if it is not attuned.

Spell Modifiers
================
At any time when casting a spell, it can be *modified* to alter or improve its effects. Modifiers allow any spell to be customized deeply for each individual cast, at the cost of additional casting difficulty or Anima.

You may choose to lower components when modifying them, but this does not change the spell's difficulty.

Range
--------
Range may be increased or decreased incrementally, following the chart below. Further difficulty increases are additive.

    * - Range
      - 
      - Difficulty
    * - Self
      - The spell may only target yourself.

      - +1
    * - Sense
      - Can target any square you can accurately sense.
      - +2

Duration
--------
Duration may be increased or decreased incrementally, following the chart below. Further difficulty increases are additive. Longer durations may be impossible without outside intervention.

    :widths: 12 50 5
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - Duration

      - Persists until you spend any further Stamina or Anima.
      - 0
    * - Brief
      - Lasts a number of rounds equal to your Insight.
      - +1
    * - Scene
      - Lasts a single scene.
      - +2
    * - Scenes
      - Lasts a number of scenes equal to your Insight.
      - +2

      - Lasts a number of rests equal to your Insight.
      - +2
    * - Lifetime
      - Lasts until you, the caster, dies.
      - +2
    * - Eternal
      - Lasts until dispelled.
      - +2

.. caution::
  A spell's duration cannot be "cancelled" until it runs its course naturally.

Damage / Healing
--------
Spells that either deal or heal damage may have that amount increased by 1 for each point you increase its difficulty by. Only *direct* healing or damage can be modified; those of conditions or secondary effects remain unaffected. For spells that use an area of effect or affect multiple targets, each increase instead costs 2 difficulty. This **does not include** split or expanded spells (see below), as they already double the necessary cost.

Split Spells
--------
Spells aimed at a lone target may be altered to instead affect multiple. Choose a number of separate targets up to your rank in the spell's path + 1, then double the final difficulty of the spell.

Expanded Spells
--------
Spells with an area of effect may be altered to cover an even greater area. Expand its AoE to include all squares adjacent, then double the final difficulty of the spell.

Guided Spells
--------
Spells may be guided to attack your targets in unexpected ways. At the cost of 1 difficulty, the spell ignores any cover penalties your target(s) may have, including full cover. The first time per combat you use a guided spell, any targets receive a -2 die penalty to dodge it.

Quickened Spells
--------
You can rapidly cast spells, though the process is exhausting. Quickened spells ignore the limit of one spell per turn at the cost of 1 Stamina, in addition to 1 difficulty for each prior spell. You can cast up to two quickened spells in the same turn, for a total of three spells.

If you have no ranks in any martial paths, you ignore the Stamina cost to cast quickened spells. You lose this benefit should you learn a martial path at any point.

Rituals
==========
*Rituals* make use of mystical events, arcane sigils, powerful catalysts, or the efforts of many magi in order to achieve an effect much more powerful than an ordinary spell. These are normally roleplay-centered plot elements, reshaping the narrative, but it is entirely possible to escape this definition and tinker as you please.

Should you wish to design a ritual to perform, or otherwise perform a spell at a difficulty impossible alone, consult with your GM to work out what's appropriate for your campaign.
