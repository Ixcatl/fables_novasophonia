Spellcasting
**************
*Spells* are carefully-crafted methods through which one can wield latent magic. A prospective caster, drawing on their own Anima, uses the discipline of a specific spell to bring their wants into reality.

Preparing Spells
==========
Similar to weapon arts, while resting, you assign your spells to Technique slots for ease of use. Certain spells may require a choice or alteration to be made on preparation, changing their effects accordingly.

.. attention::
  For a comprehensive list of existing spells to learn, see :doc:`Catalog: Spells </catalog/spells>`.

Casting & Aiming Spells
==========
Unless a spell specifies otherwise, only one may be cast per turn.

To cast a spell, you must first spend Anima equal to its resulting difficulty score. If your spell targets a willing creature, there is no need to roll and the spell automatically succeeds. If your target is unwilling, or is an object wielded by an unwilling creature, the spell requires an attack roll unless otherwise specified.

| When casting a spell with a range of *touch*, its attack roll is based on Might or Insight, at your preference. If the spell is longer ranged, its attack roll is based on Grace or Insight instead. You then add your total number of ranks in mystic paths to the roll as bonus dice.
| If a spell calls for an opposed check with your target(s), it doesn't use the normal attack roll and does not gain bonus dice from path ranks, unless the opposed check specifically calls for an attack roll.

A spell with an attack roll may be dodged, but not parried without special equipment.

Ritualized Spells
----------
Spells that you know but don't have prepared can still be performed. These *ritualized spells* are more powerful, but take far longer to cast. A spell cast in this manner may have a difficulty up to twice your total ranks in all mystic paths, but for every 1 difficulty, it takes 4 rounds to cast. This is treated as a long-term focus action.

Rituals
==========
*Rituals* make use of mystical events, ley lines, powerful catalysts, or the efforts of many magi in order to achieve an effect much more powerful than an ordinary spell. They are normally roleplay-centered plot elements important to the progress of the narrative, and are easily made impromptu.

Should you wish to design a ritual to perform, or otherwise perform a spell at a difficulty impossible alone, consult with your GM to work out what's appropriate for your campaign.

.. attention::
  For a number of example rituals to use as inspiration, see :doc:`Catalog: Rituals </catalog/rituals>`.

Spell Modifiers
================
When casting a spell at any time, it can be *modified* to alter or improve its effects. Modifiers allow any spell to be customized deeply for each individual cast, at the cost of additional casting difficulty.

Note that only certain components of spells may be given range, duration, or damage/healing modifiers, indicated clearly by a line above the spell's extended description, such as "Range A: Close". Unless the spell states otherwise, statistics not listed in this way cannot be modified.

You may choose to lower components when modifying them, but this does not change the spell's difficulty.

Range
--------
Range may be increased or decreased incrementally, following the chart below. Further difficulty increases are additive.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 12 50 5
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - Range
      - 
      - Difficulty
    * - Self
      - The spell may only target yourself.
      - 0
    * - Touch
      - Can target squares that may be touched with an unarmed attack - typically within a melee range of 1.
      - +1
    * - Close
      - Can target squares equal to or less than half your Insight +1, rounded up.
      - +1
    * - Far
      - Can target squares equal to or less than your Insight +3.
      - +1
    * - Sense
      - Can target any square you can accurately sense.
      - +2

Duration
--------
Duration may be increased or decreased incrementally, following the chart below. Further difficulty increases are additive, and longer durations may be impossible without outside intervention.

.. caution::
  A spell's duration cannot be "cancelled" until it runs its course naturally.
