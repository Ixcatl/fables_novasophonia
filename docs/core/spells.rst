Spellcasting
**************
*Spells* consist of the carefully-crafted methods through which one can wield latent magic. A prospective caster, drawing on their own Anima, uses the trained discipline of a specific spell to bring their wants into reality.

Preparing Spells
==========
Similar to weapon arts, while resting, a character assigns their spells to Technique slots for ease of use. Certain spells may require a choice or alteration to be made on preparation, changing their effects accordingly.

Casting & Aiming Spells
==========
Unless a spell is modified or specifies otherwise, only one may be cast per turn.

To cast a spell, a creature must first spend Anima equal to its resulting difficulty score. If the spell targets a willing creature, there is no need to roll and the spell automatically succeeds. If the target is unwilling, or is an object wielded by an unwilling creature, the spell requires an attack roll unless otherwise specified.

When casting a spell with a range of *touch*, its attack roll is based on Brawn or Savvy, at the caster's preference. If the spell is longer ranged, its attack roll is based on Grace or Savvy instead. The caster then adds their total number of ranks in mystic paths to the roll as bonus dice.

| A spell may be dodged, but not parried without special equipment.
| If the spell calls for a unique check or roll (such as an opposed check) from the caster or target, the caster doesn't add their total mystic ranks to their roll as they normally would. Spells which make an explicit check against the *caster's spell attack roll* are an exception to this rule and still use the bonus dice.

Ritualized Spells
----------
| Spells that a character knows but doesn't have prepared can still be performed. These *ritualized spells* are more powerful, but take far longer to cast.
| The spell may have a difficulty up to twice the character's *total* ranks in all mystic paths, but for every 1 difficulty the ritualized spell has, it takes 4 rounds to cast.

Rituals
==========
*Rituals* make use of mystical events, ley lines, powerful catalysts, or the efforts of many mages in order to achieve an effect much more powerful than an ordinary spell. They are normally roleplay-centered plot elements important to the progress of a narrative arc, and are easily made impromptu for the campaign.

Should you wish to design a ritual for your character to perform, or perform a spell at a difficulty impossible alone, consult with your Game Master to work out what's appropriate for their game.
