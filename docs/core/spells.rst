Spellcasting
**************
*Spells* consist of the carefully-crafted methods through which one can wield latent magic. A prospective caster, drawing on their own Anima, uses the trained discipline of a specific spell to bring their wants into reality.

Preparing Spells
==========
Similar to weapon arts, a character assigns their spells to Technique slots for ease of use. They can cast prepared spells with a difficulty of up to twice their ranks in its associated path.

Casting & Aiming Spells
==========
Unless a spell is modified or specified, only one spell may be cast per turn.

To cast a spell, a creature must first spend Anima equal to its final difficulty score. If the spell targets a willing creature, there is no need to roll and the spell automatically succeeds. If the target is unwilling, or is an object wielded by an unwilling creature, the spell requires an attack roll unless otherwise specified.

When casting a spell with a range of *touch*, its attack roll is based on Brawn or Savvy, at the caster's preference. If the spell is longer ranged, its attack roll is based on Grace or Savvy instead. The caster then adds their total number of ranks in mystic paths to the roll as bonus dice.

| A spell may be dodged, but not parried without special equipment.
| If a spell calls for the caster to make an opposed attribute check, it doesn't require a roll to hit, with the target instead using an opposed spell resistance check (unless otherwise specifed). The caster does not add their total mystic ranks to such a check as they would normally.
