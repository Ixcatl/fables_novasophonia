Items
**************
Managing one's haul is an essential part of any adventurer's toolkit. Carefully weighing what supplies you need with the loot you want is a tightrope act played over the course of the entire campaign.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bulk, Load, & the Belt
==========
*This is a synopsis. Refer to :doc:`Attributes & Pools </core/attributes>`: :ref:`core/attributes:load` & :ref:`core/attributes:belt slots`.*

Every single physical object has Bulk. Any character can carry points of Bulk up to their Load (or up to double, with a penalty), determined by their Might attribute rounded down. Items which have a Bulk of "Light" weigh 1/3 of a point; every third Light item carried is counted as 1 Bulk. Some worn items and equipment may ease a character's Load, allowing them to carry more.

A character's Belt is where they store items for quick access, determined by Mettle rounded down. An item placed on the Belt takes up Belt slots equal to its Bulk, 1 at minimum. Similarly, any item moved to or from the hands anywhere other than the Belt costs Speed equal to that item's Bulk, 1 at minimum; they can also be dropped to the ground without costing Speed. Items on the belt still count against Load.

Value
==========
Most items have a given *value*, designated by a ☼ symbol. This doesn't mean any currency in particular; rather, it signifies the bartering power of any given item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currency & Materials
==========
No matter where a campaign may go, many different crafting materials permeate the worlds. Thanks to widespread appraisal magicks, minted tokens are not necessary in most storefronts - instead, metals and other commodities are bartered in their raw forms. Thus, **this ruleset does not use traditional RPG currency**; every item you can pick up is a potential trading piece to someone, somewhere.

Bits
----------
For the sake of not overcomplicating one's inventory, all common materials are measured in *bits*, which may mix and stack up to 10 as one Light item. At a baseline, they do not have any mechanical differences beyond their item tags, but higher value bits are easier to carry for trade and crafting.

Commodities
----------
Items which are frequently used for trade. All commodities can stack up to a specified limit in the space of one Light item, and unlike bits they cannot mix.

    * - Glimmer
      - 10
      - 1☼
      - A jumble of metallic shards and nuggets too impure for regular use, sometimes circulated as an *ad hoc* currency. Anytime during a rest, 10 units of glimmer can be spent to scavenge usable bits of metal. After doing so, roll a d6, which yields 5 bits' worth of the respective metal: lead, tin, copper, iron, bronze, or brass.
      - \-
    * - Metal Ingot
      - 1
      - Varies
      - A standard, heavy, ready-to-use metal bar. One ingot has the same value as 15 bits of its respective metal, or 10 bits for exotic metals. When used for crafting, any excess is refunded as bits, rounded down by value as usual.
      - metal
    * - Chunk of Wood
      - 1
      - 10☼
      - Refined or not, a piece of this quality could be whittled into something much more useful. When used for crafting, any excess value is refunded as wood bits, at 2 bits per 1☼.

Sundries
----------
Items usually not important enough to mention elsewhere, but could still be necessary for crafting or roleplay. Included to give GMs an appropriate pricing point for shops.

Collectibles

Items that grant permanent boosts when consumed. Collectibles work great as treasure for inquisitive characters due to how universally useful they are; it's recommended to have at least a few of these tucked into dark corners.

    * - Item
      - Bulk
      - Value
      - Description / Effects
    * - Pouch
      - Light
      - 30☼
      - A standard pouch may hold up 3 non-container Light items, which do not count against the Load of the creature carrying it. Contained items that could be damaged by environmental hazards aren't harmed unless the pouch is destroyed first. If on the Belt, items within may be accessed as if they were on the Belt as well.
    * - Sheath
      - Light
      - 30☼
      - A specialized carrying sling, scabbard, bag or harness meant for a specific piece of equipment, chosen when the sheath is made. A sheath can carry one item, reducing its effective Bulk by 1 if on the Belt; any additional Bulk is counted against Load as normal. Similarly to a pouch, the contained item is not affected by its environment unless the sheath is destroyed first, and can be accessed as if from the Belt. Additionally, if designed for an item that casts light, it still provides light.
    * - Rope, 1 square
      - Light
      - 1☼
      - A length of durable rope, useful for climbing or hauling. For these purposes, it has a Load cap of 5, and breaks if it exceeds its Load.
    * - Chain, 1 square
      - Light
      - 5☼
      - Handy in situations where regular rope wouldn't make the cut. For climbing or hauling, it has a Load cap of 10, and breaks if it exceeds its Load.
    * - Fuse, 1 square
      - Light
      - 5☼
      - A bit of normal rope treated in a special flammable solution. When lit, it rapidly burns away and ignites whatever it is attached to; a flask bursts instead, applying its effect to its viscinity.
    * - Hand Pump
      - Light
      - 50☼
      - A portable contraption used to pump fluids into a container, or to expel them in a spray. When used to eject a flask, its contents affect a Line(2) AoE instead of being thrown. Terrain+ flasks affect a Cone(3) instead.
    * - Luminous Plant
      - Light
      - 5☼
      - Glowing moss, flowers, bulbs or likewise pulled from the environment. Passively lights a radius of 1 square from its bearer, or can be taken in a free hand to increase the radius to 2. This light fades to nothing after the next rest.
    * - Flash
      - Light
      - 25☼
      - A handy lamp using impetus gas to make light. It passively lights a radius of 3 squares from its bearer, or can be taken in a free hand to increase the radius to 5. Flashes are fragile and break if dropped or damaged, releasing the impetus like a flask.
    * - Lantern
      - 1
      - 50☼
      - A reliable source of light. A lantern must be fueled with a specific flask fluid, chosen when it is made; when lit for the first time during a scene, it functions until the end of the scene. When turned on, it lights a radius of 4 squares from its bearer, or can be taken in a free hand to increase the radius to 6. Lanterns requiring rarer fluids may last more than one scene when filled.
    * - Soul Catcher
      - Light
      - 100☼
      - A special crystal embedded into an enchanted frame, this dubious device is charged by extracting Anima from dead creatures, storing it to be called upon later. An empty soul catcher can be filled by waving it over a fresh corpse. It contains 1 Anima when filled, which may be drawn out as a focus action.
    * - Oil Snail
      - Light
      - 50☼
      - A small and lazy breed of snail which naturally produces an oily substance. Every rest, the snail produces enough oil to fill one flask. While carried on the Belt, oil coating its bearer does not wear off naturally.
