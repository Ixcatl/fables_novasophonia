Items

Managing one's haul is an essential part of any adventurer's toolkit. Carefully weighing what supplies you need with the loot you want is a tightrope act played over the course of the entire campaign.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bulk, Load, & the Belt
==========
*This is a synopsis. Refer to :doc:`Attributes & Pools </core/attributes>`: :ref:`core/attributes:load` & :ref:`core/attributes:belt slots`.*

Every single physical object has Bulk. Any character can carry points of Bulk up to their Load (or up to double, with a penalty), determined by their Might attribute rounded down. Items which have a Bulk of "Light" weigh 1/3 of a point; every third Light item carried is counted as 1 Bulk. Some worn items and equipment may ease a character's Load, allowing them to carry more.

A character's Belt is where they store items for quick access, determined by Mettle rounded down. An item placed on the Belt takes up Belt slots equal to its Bulk, 1 at minimum. Similarly, any item moved to or from the hands anywhere other than the Belt costs Speed equal to that item's Bulk, 1 at minimum; they can also be dropped to the ground without costing Speed. Items on the belt still count against Load.

Value
==========
Most items have a given *value*, designated by a ☼ symbol. This doesn't mean any currency in particular; rather, it signifies the bartering power of any given item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Materials & Currency
==========
No matter where a campaign may go, many different crafting materials permeate the worlds. Thanks to widespread appraisal magicks, minted tokens are not necessary in most storefronts - instead, metals and other commodities are bartered in their raw forms. Thus, **this ruleset does not use traditional RPG currency**; every copper, silver, or gold piece are items

      - 1☼
      - A jumble of metallic shards and nuggets too impure for regular use, sometimes circulated as an *ad hoc* currency. Anytime during a rest, 10 units of glimmer can be spent to scavenge usable bits of metal. After doing so, roll a d6, which yields 4 bits' worth of the respective metal: lead, tin, copper, iron, bronze, or brass.

    * - Metal Bar
      - 1
      - Varies
      - A standard, heavy, ready-to-use metal ingot. One bar has the same value as 15 bits of its respective metal. When used for crafting, any excess is reduced to bits, rounded down by value.

Metals
----------
For the sake of not overcomplicating one's inventory, all metals are measured in *bits*, which may mix and stack up to 10 as one Light item. At a baseline, they do not have any mechanical differences, but higher value metals are easier to carry for trade and crafting.

Collectibles

Items that grant permanent boosts when consumed. Collectibles work great as treasure for inquisitive players due to how generally useful they are; it's recommended that any good campaign have at least a few of these tucked into dark corners.
