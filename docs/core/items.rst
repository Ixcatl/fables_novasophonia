Managing one's haul is an essential part of any adventurer's toolkit. Carefully weighing what supplies you need with the loot you want is a tightrope act played over the course of the entire campaign.

Bulk, Load, & the Belt
==========
*This is a synopsis. Refer to :doc:`Attributes & Pools </core/attributes>`: :ref:`core/attributes:load` & :ref:`core/attributes:belt slots`.*

Every single physical object has Bulk. Any character can carry points of Bulk up to their Load (or up to double, with a penalty), determined by their Might attribute rounded down. Items which have a Bulk of "Light" weigh 1/3 of a point; every third Light item carried is counted as 1 Bulk. Some worn items and equipment may ease a character's Load, allowing them to carry more.

A character's Belt is where they store items for quick access, determined by Mettle rounded down. An item placed on the Belt takes up Belt slots equal to its Bulk, 1 at minimum. Similarly, any item moved to or from the hands anywhere other than the Belt costs Speed equal to that item's Bulk, 1 at minimum; they can also be dropped to the ground without costing Speed. Items on the belt still count against Load.

Value
==========
Most items have a given *value*, designated by a â˜¼ symbol. This doesn't mean any currency in particular; rather, it signifies the bartering power of any given item. Many currencies might exist between differing cultures, often being useful items themselves.
