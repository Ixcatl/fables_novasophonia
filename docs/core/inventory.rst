Inventory
**************
Managing one's haul is an intrinsic part of any adventurer's toolkit. Carefully weighing what supplies you need with the loot you want is a tightrope act played over the course of the entire campaign.

Load & Belt
==========
Refer to :doc:`Attributes & Pools </core/attributes>`: :ref:`core/attributes:load` and :ref:`core/attributes:belt slots`. Creatures with worse scores in these attributes will have a more difficult time carrying their items.

Containers
==========
While one could simply carry their items on their back, or use belt slots on their own, various items exist to ease such a burden.

Backpacks
----------
Most creatures have a *back slot* for a piece of equipment, and *backpacks* are one of the most useful tools for the job.
