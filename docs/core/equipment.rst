Weapons
==========

Weapon Quality
----------
The *quality* of a weapon denotes the amount of dice added to the roll when attacking with the weapon. Weapons in their base form have 1 quality, altered by weapon upgrades and certain modifiers.

Heavy Weapons
----------
Weapons of 2 or more Bulk are *heavy*, and give a stack of Off-Balance whenever an attack is made with them.

Handedness
----------
Some weapons normally require two hands to wield. A character with 5 or greater Brawn may wield these weapons in one hand, but some are too unwieldy even for those strong enough, and are always two-handed (2h+).

Weapon Ranges
----------
| Weapons with a range of *melee* can be used to attack targets adjacent to the wielder.
| *Reach* weapons have an attack range of 2 squares. These attacks are still considered to be melee.
| *Ranged* weapons have a range in squares denoted by the weapon. Unlike melee, ranged attacks use a Grace roll by default. Some weapons intended for throwing can have both melee and ranged attacks.

Paired Weapons
----------
When a character wields two light weapons, they can be *paired*. A character that makes an attack with a weapon can then perform a paired attack with the other paired weapon. A paired attack costs one less Stamina to initiate, though it is still taxed.

Both weapons must be wielded when the first attack is made. The next attack after a paired attack cannot be paired in the same turn.

Weapon Abilities
----------
Weapons each have their own unique abiltiies, separate from their weapon type. These provide an advantage against certain enemies, or increase a character's versatility on the battlefield, making every weapon useful in its own way.

Weapon Types & Damage
----------
Each weapon type has a certain playstyle and damage type associated with it. When making an attack with a weapon, one may choose between any of the damage types its weapon types allow, unless the weapon itself states what damage it uses.

*Blade* weapons are reliable and versatile, but lack the hard counters that make other weapons intimidating. They allow :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>`.

*Lance* weapons can be found in the hands of mobile combatants who favor Grace over Brawn, and seek to outmaneuver their foes. They allow :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Hook* weapons are favored by tricksters and opportunists, designed to catch a foe at their weakest and tear them down. Uniquely, hook users can choose between :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>` or :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Club* weapons, with their oppressive weight and force, are all about inflicting raw damage. They allow :term:`Blunt damage <damage type: blunt>`.

*Ranged* weapons keep the wielder away from the enemy and out of harm's way. They do not allow any explicit damage types, and pure ranged weapons typically state whichever they use.
