Weapons
==========

Weapon Quality
----------
The *Quality* of a weapon denotes the amount of dice added to the roll when attacking with the weapon. Weapons in their base form have 1 Quality, altered by upgrades and certain modifiers.

Weapon Types & Damage
----------
Each weapon type has a certain playstyle and damage type associated with it. When making an attack, one may choose between any of the damage types its weapon types allow, unless the weapon specifies which damage it uses.

*Blade* weapons are reliable and versatile, but lack the hard counters that make others intimidating. They allow :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>`.

*Lance* weapons can be found in the hands of mobile combatants who aim to make the first move. They allow :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Hook* weapons are favored by tricksters and opportunists, designed to catch a foe at their weakest and tear them down. Uniquely, hook users can choose between :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>` or :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Club* weapons, with their oppressive weight and force, are all about inflicting raw damage. They allow :term:`Blunt damage <damage type: blunt>`.

| *Ranged* or *thrown* weapons keep the wielder away from the enemy and out of harm's way. They do not allow any additional damage types, and pure ranged weapons typically state whichever they use.
| Ranged weapons are treated as having unlimited ammunition, to avoid micromanaging every arrow or stone. Special ammo such as magic arrows are, however, consumed on use. Thrown weapons leave the hands, but can still be recovered during or after combat.
| If making a ranged attack with a weapon of these types at an adjacent target, it provokes an attack of opportunity from that target.

.. tip::
   Thrown weapons which successfully deal any amount of Sharp or Pierce damage *embed* into the target, and remain attached to them until either the attacker or the victim collects them as normal.

Weapon Range
----------
| Weapons with a range of *melee* can be used to attack targets adjacent to the wielder.
| *Reach* weapons have an attack range of 2 squares. These attacks are still considered to be melee.
| *Ranged* weapons have a range in squares denoted by the weapon, defaulting to 3 if necessary. Unlike melee, ranged attacks use a Grace roll. Most weapons intended for throwing have both melee and ranged attacks.

Handedness
----------
Some weapons normally require two hands to wield. A character with 5 or greater Might may wield these weapons in one hand, but some are too unwieldy even for those strong enough, and are always two-handed (2h+).

Heavy Weapons
----------
Weapons of 2 or more Bulk are *heavy*, and give a stack of Off-Balance whenever an attack is made with them.

Paired Weapons
----------
When a character wields two light weapons, they can be *paired*. A character that makes an attack with a weapon can then perform a paired attack with the other paired weapon. A paired attack costs one less Stamina to initiate, though it is still taxed.

Both weapons must be wielded when the first attack is made. The next attack after one that's been paired cannot be paired.

Weapon Abilities
----------
Weapons each have their own unique abilities separate from their weapon type. These provide an advantage against certain enemies, or increase a character's versatility on the battlefield, making every weapon useful in its own way.

List of Weapons
----------
This is a table of most battle implements one would find in their adventures. A GM is free to create their own, or base their magic weapons on any of these.

Improvised Weapons & Tools
----------
An *improvised* weapon bases its damage, Bulk, and abilities on the template of a similar weapon. Regardless of what they are based on, they have a throwing range of 3; however, they have 0 Quality, cannot be modified, and suffer -1 die penalty on attack rolls.

Certain tools make for surprisingly effective weapons, too. Unlike improvised weapons, they don't gain a throwing range. They have 1 Quality, cannot be modified, and suffer -1 die penalty on attack rolls. If a character is familiar with a certain tool, they can add their ranks in a relevant skill as rerolls on the attack roll.

Not all objects or tools are suitable to be used as a weapon.

Unarmed Strikes
----------
An unarmed strike is considered to be a natural weapon for all intents and purposes, with a Quality of 1, 1 base damage, and Light Bulk. The Quality of an unarmed strike applies to grapple attempts.

Any creature can make an unarmed attack at almost any time; a creature without arms or legs can still perform a headbutt.

Modifying a Weapon
----------
Weapon *modifiers* improve weapons in ways that aren't always direct upgrades. Instead, they could make a weapon lighter or heavier, add an extra weapon type, or even allow it to turn into a different weapon.

A weapon can only have a single modifier, with some exceptions. If the weapon is of Light Bulk, the cost of a modifier is half its required value rounded up, except for Worn.

          - When casting a spell that uses a normal spell attack, the wielder may instead choose to use this weapon's attack to deliver it, adding Anima spent as bonus dice. Should it hit, the attack is processed as it normally would, but also counts as a hit for the cast spell. If the weapon attack was AoE, the spell only hits one of the attack's targets, unless it is split, where it would hit an appropriate amount of targets for split spells. If the *spell* is AoE, the entire AoE is cast centered on the target; the caster must make normal spell attack rolls against other targets caught in its radius. The minimum range for a Sorcerous spell is touch.

Weapon Upgrades
----------
Weapon upgrades increase the Quality of a weapon. Each upgrade is acquired in sequence, and replaces its previous tier. Certain special weapons may have more prerequisites than the ones listed.

Upgrades are not modifiers, as such they can coexist on any given weapon.

To upgrade a weapon, under most circumstances, one must find a weaponsmith of passing skill and provide them with a barter for their services, in addition to any exotic materials they may require. Searching for a smith skilled enough to create Prime or Zenith weapons may become a considerable quest in itself.

Shields
==========

Shields and Handedness
----------
Shields are always carried in one hand.

Shield Bashes
----------
A shield can be used to attack a creature. A *shield bash* is a pairable 0 Quality attack with 2 base damage. The attack has no rollover, unless the shield has the Balanced modifier.

List of Shields
----------
Shields here are considered to be templates; one may flavor them however they desire.

    * - Greatshield
      - 0
      - 2
      - 200☼
      - At the end of their turn, the bearer of a greatshield may choose a side of the square(s) they occupy. The shield acts as a wall along that side of them until they choose to end this effect. The side the shield is facing may be changed off-turn for 1 Stamina. Attacks against the shield may be parried using it. Deployed greatshields have a Durability of 4 + Quality, an Absorption of 4, and a soak score of 3. Weapon damage against the shield is dealt to Durability instead of Quality. For every extra square the greatshield needs to cover when deployed, such as with a large creature's 2x2 size, it gains +1 Bulk.

Shield Modifiers
----------
Shields can be modified exactly like weapons, with their own array of modifiers, but are still limited to just one.

        * - Trick
          - Choose a weapon. At the cost of 1 Stamina, this shield may change shape into that weapon and back. Its Bulk is equal to the higher of the two forms; the weapon's Quality is equal to the shield's Quality +1.

        * - Balanced
          - The shield becomes a viable weapon when used to bash. A shield with 2+ Bulk now has 4 base damage; a shield with 1 Bulk has 3 base damage; a Light shield has 2 base damage. The weapon Quality of its shield bash is equal to its Quality +1. Its rollover cap is also treated as that of a normal weapon's.
          - 50☼ + 1/2 base value
        * - Reflective

          - 50☼ + 1/2 base value

Shield Upgrades
----------
Shields can also be upgraded. However, unlike weapons, they have fewer upgrade tiers.

Armor
==========

Equipping Armor
----------
Putting on or taking off a set of armor during combat costs 1 Stamina for light armor, 2 for medium, and 3 for heavy.

Damage Reduction with Armor
----------
Heavier armor provides *damage reduction*, or DR. Damage reduction from armor removes flat points from :term:`physical damage <damage class: physical>` risked, but not environmental or magical. More information on DR here(LINK TO COMBAT).

Durability
----------
When an attack rolls at least one 6 and successfully hits, it deals 1 damage to the target's armor Durability. Armor with 0 Durability is broken and provides no benefits until repaired.

List of Armor
----------
Armor can vary widely among the three tiers, and can be flavored however one would like in any way that makes sense.

Armor Modifiers
----------
Like weapons and shields, armor can be modified. Uniquely, though, armor may have any number of modifiers applied to it at once.

          - 100☼ + base value
        * - Lustrous
          - The armor provides a bonus equal to its DR + 1 on opposed rolls to resist spell effects. Spell attacks may also be soaked with dice equal to the armor's DR + 1.
          - 300☼ + base value

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arcane Foci
==========

Focus Attunement
----------
In order to benefit from an arcane focus' ability to store spells or arts, a character must first attune to it, done freely during any rest. They may only be attuned to a single arcane focus at a time, but can unattune at will.

Stored Techniques
----------
An arcane focus can contain spells and arts for use, as if its Quality were Technique slots. A stored weapon art can be performed using the arcane focus, even if it is not the correct weapon type, but cannot be performed with other weapons unless prepared in a normal Technique slot.

Any stored techniques vanish if the character unattunes the focus or dies; however, an attuned focus can be used by another character to perform contained techniques, while the attuned character maintains the connection.

A focus must normally be attuned and held in at least one hand to receive its benefits and perform techniques stored within.

Focus Upgrades
----------
All foci begin with 1 Quality. An amount of dice equal to Quality is added to regular attack rolls made with an arcane focus.

A GM may ask for more esoteric or unusual materials to be put towards an upgrade's overall cost.

Tools
==========
A tool is any implement designed to aid in proficiency or skill checks. Using a tool adds its Quality as rerolls to checks appropriate for the tool. Some checks may be deemed impossible without an appropriate tool.

Tools at their baseline have 1 Quality. In cases where a tool is required, it is possible to improvise one if anything is available that could realistically be used for the task. Improvised tools have 0 Quality if they are an extremely appropriate body part, or -1 Quality otherwise.

The value of a tool is based on the rarity of its profession. A cooking knife may be as cheap as 10☼, while a set of surgical equipment could be as expensive as 100☼.

Tools as Weapons
----------
Some tools can be used as an ad hoc weapon. If so, select one weapon to temporarily use as its archetype. For instance, a climbing hook would be a normal hook, while a pickaxe could function like a hammer using Pierce damage. These tools follow the usual rules for improvised weapons.

Upgrading Tools
----------
Tools usable as weapons follow the weapon upgrade tiers. Otherwise, they are upgraded as arcane foci instead, with an additional 3rd and 4th tier costing 600☼ and 750☼ respectively.

Example Tools
----------
The following tools aren't a comprehensive list; however, they can serve to give players and GMs an idea of how tools could be priced, or what kinds of weapons they could emulate.

Accessories
==========
Accessories are items worn on the person without using Belt slots. Some may take their own special slots, while others are freely equipped on the body. Two accessories which use the same slot cannot be used together, unless the creature has more than one of that particular body part, such as hands or feet.

Equipped accessories, much like wielded weapons or worn armor, still weigh Bulk on their bearer.
