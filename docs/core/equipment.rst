Weapons
==========

Weapon Quality
----------
The *quality* of a weapon denotes the amount of dice added to the roll when attacking with the weapon. Weapons in their base form have 1 quality, altered by weapon upgrades and certain modifiers.

Heavy Weapons
----------
Weapons of 2 or more Bulk are *heavy*, and give a stack of Off-Balance whenever an attack is made with them.

Handedness
----------
Some weapons normally require two hands to wield. A character with 5 or greater Brawn may wield these weapons in one hand, but some are too unwieldy even for those strong enough, and are always two-handed (2h+).

Weapon Ranges
----------
| Weapons with a range of *melee* can be used to attack targets adjacent to the wielder.
| *Reach* weapons have an attack range of 2 squares. These attacks are still considered to be melee.
| *Ranged* weapons have a range in squares denoted by the weapon. Unlike melee, ranged attacks use a Grace roll by default. Some weapons intended for throwing can have both melee and ranged attacks.

Paired Weapons
----------
When a character wields two light weapons, they can be *paired*. A character that makes an attack with a weapon can then perform a paired attack with the other paired weapon. A paired attack costs one less Stamina to initiate, though it is still taxed.

Both weapons must be wielded when the first attack is made. The next attack after one that's been paired cannot be paired in the same turn.

Weapon Abilities
----------
Weapons each have their own unique abiltiies, separate from their weapon type. These provide an advantage against certain enemies, or increase a character's versatility on the battlefield, making every weapon useful in its own way.

Weapon Types & Damage
----------
Each weapon type has a certain playstyle and damage type associated with it. When making an attack with a weapon, one may choose between any of the damage types its weapon types allow, unless the weapon itself states what damage it uses.

*Blade* weapons are reliable and versatile, but lack the hard counters that make other weapons intimidating. They allow :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>`.

*Lance* weapons can be found in the hands of mobile combatants who prefer Grace over Brawn, and seek to outmaneuver their foes. They allow :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Hook* weapons are favored by tricksters and opportunists, designed to catch a foe at their weakest and tear them down. Uniquely, hook users can choose between :term:`Sharp damage <damage type: sharp>` or :term:`Pierce damage <damage type: pierce>`.

*Club* weapons, with their oppressive weight and force, are all about inflicting raw damage. They allow :term:`Blunt damage <damage type: blunt>`.

| *Ranged* or *thrown* weapons keep the wielder away from the enemy and out of harm's way. They do not allow any additional damage types, and pure ranged weapons typically state whichever they use.
| Ranged weapons are treated as having unlimited ammunition, to avoid micromanaging every arrow or stone. Special ammo such as magic arrows are, however, consumed on use. Thrown weapons leave the hands when used, but can still be recovered during or after combat.
| If making a ranged attack with a weapon of these types at an adjacent target, it provokes an attack of opportunity from that target.

List of Weapons
