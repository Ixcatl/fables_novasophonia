Attribute Checks
****************

When a character is faced with a particularly troublesome task, one where success isn't guaranteed, the GM may require them to roll an Attribute check.
These checks will usually be called by their associated Attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" drawing from that character's Grace Attribute.

.. note::

   If an Attribute has half a point, ending in .5, the Attribute is rounded down to the nearest whole number and a reroll is granted to the check instead.

Direct Checks
=============

Direct checks are usually rolled when a character takes an action that carries some risk of failure, and doesn't oppose any other characters.
