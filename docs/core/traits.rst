Traits
******

Some particular species may have qualities that make them unique, known as Traits. Under most conditions, these cannot be gained through play - though the GM is free to get creative if they so choose.

Indented Traits are Sub-Traits, modifying the associated non-Sub-Trait they are found under.

Unless Traits are present that say otherwise, most characters are assumed to be omnivorous with two legs, two arms, two eyes and ears, and a tail.
