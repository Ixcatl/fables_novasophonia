Rolling Dice
==========

UWR, identically to HKRPG, features a "dice pool" mechanic at its core, using six-sided dice almost exclusively and counting successes rather than high or low rolls. Each player will want about eight dice, though even more might be necessary in longer campaigns.

Most actions require a roll, or "check", to count successes by rolling with d6s. Each die that rolls a 5 or 6 is a success; anything below normally does not. Checks between two characters may pit their rolls against one another; others will require a static target of winning dice to succeed. Every different type of die roll has its own way of determining the number of dice and what its succeeding conditions are.

| When making a roll, a player may have access to a certain number of :term:`rerolls <reroll>`. Immediately after a roll is made (but before it is finalized), the player may choose a failed die for each allowed reroll and roll them again. The better of the two outcomes is then used and tallied up with the rest.
| As a rule of thumb, any time where you would be left with half a die - such as a check with an Attribute ending in .5 - a single extra reroll is given.

Certain exceptionally easy rolls may also :term:`favor` towards the lower end. A check with +1 favor, for instance, will have a success range of 4-6 instead of 5-6, making it substantially easier to pass.

Attribute Checks
================
When someone is faced with a difficult task without any guarantee of success, the GM may require them to roll an Attribute check. These come in two different flavors, *direct* and *opposed*, usually called by their associated Attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" or "Grace roll" drawing from that character's Grace Attribute.

Direct Checks
-------------
Direct checks are usually rolled when a character takes an action that carries some risk of failure, and doesn't directly oppose any other characters.

The GM declares which primary Attribute should be used (Brawn, Grace, Mettle, Savvy). The player then rolls dice equal to that Attribute, adding a number of :term:`bonus dice <die bonus>` equal to their ranks in one relevant skill. If the number of successes equal or surpass the target set by the GM, the player wins.

.. Tip::
   Below is a table with example difficulties for direct checks, for a GM's perusal:

   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Example Action                             | Difficulty                  |
   +============================================+=============================+
   | **Easy**: Climb using a rope               | 1 success, +1 favor         |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Normal**: Climb a rough surface          | 1 success                   |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Difficult**: Climb a wet or flat surface | 2 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Extreme**: Climb a wet overhang          | 3 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

For example: a player character attempts to tiptoe their way along a narrow branch, and the GM calls for a Grace roll. The player asks if their "Acrobatics" skill is relevant, and the GM agrees, granting the roll a die bonus equal to their rank in "Burglar", the proficiency that grants them this skill. Highly specific skills can give bonus rerolls; in this particular example, having a "Balancing" skill may add one, but a "Tightroping" skill may add two instead.

Opposed Checks
--------------
One character resisting or disrupting the effects of another's actions may need to roll an opposed check. These are made similarly to direct checks, except each success negates one from the other character's check.

STOPPED HERE DIPSHIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

TODO: stress that opposed checks aren't always announced by the GM, such as for lies

.. Tip::

   If two opposed checks roll evenly, the character *reacting to the action made* wins by default.

For example: Inquisitor Hildebrand is interrogating a farm-mouse for information, who makes a roll attempt to lie to her. In this particular case, Hildebrand's player would make a Savvy check, plus a die bonus equal to her total "Kenning" skill with the GM's permission. If as many or more successes are rolled than the liar rolled to deceive, the deception is revealed.
