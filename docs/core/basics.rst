Basic Mechanics
******
UWR may have a veneer of a traditional fantasy RPG, but most of its mechanics are not shared with the likes of D&D or Pathfinder. It's important to get to know the basics laid out on this page in order to understand the rest of the game systems.

----------------------------

Rolling Dice
==========

UWR, identically to HKRPG, features a "dice pool" mechanic at its core, using six-sided dice almost exclusively and counting successes rather than high or low rolls. Each player will want about eight dice, though even more might be necessary in longer campaigns.

Most actions require a roll, or *check*, to count successes by rolling with d6s. Each die that rolls a 5 or 6 is a success; anything below normally does not. Checks between two characters may pit their rolls against one another; others will require a static target of winning dice to succeed. Every different type of check has its own way of determining the number of dice and what its succeeding conditions are.

| When making a roll, a player may have access to a certain number of :term:`rerolls <reroll>`. Immediately after a roll is made (but before it is finalized), the player may choose a die for each allowed reroll and roll them again. The better of the two outcomes is then used and tallied up with the rest.
| As a rule of thumb, any time where you would be left with half a die - such as a check with an attribute ending in .5 - a single extra reroll is given.

Certain exceptionally easy rolls may also :term:`favor` towards the lower end. A check with +1 favor, for instance, will have a success range of 4-6 instead of 5-6, making it substantially easier to pass.

----------------------------

Attribute Checks
================
When someone is faced with a difficult task without any guarantee of success, the GM may require them to roll an *attribute check*. These come in two different flavors, *direct* and *opposed*, usually called by their associated attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" or "Grace roll" drawing from that character's Grace attribute.

Direct Checks
-------------
*Direct* checks are usually called when a character takes an action that carries some risk of failure, and doesn't directly oppose any other characters.

The GM declares which primary attribute should be used (Might, Grace, Mettle, Insight). The player then rolls dice equal to that attribute, adding a number of :term:`bonus dice <die bonus>` equal to their ranks in one relevant skill. If the number of successes equal or surpass the target set by the GM, the player wins the check.

.. tip::
   Below is a table with example difficulties for direct checks:

   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Example Action                             | Difficulty                  |
   +============================================+=============================+
   | **Easy**: Climb using a rope               | 1 success, +1 favor         |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Normal**: Climb a rough surface          | 1 success                   |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Difficult**: Climb a wet or flat surface | 2 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Extreme**: Climb a wet overhang          | 3 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

.. admonition:: Example...
   :class: note

   A player character attempts to tiptoe their way along a narrow branch. The GM calls for a Grace check; the player asks if their "Acrobatics" skill is relevant, and the GM agrees, granting the roll a die bonus equal to their rank in "Burglar", the proficiency that grants them this skill. Highly specific skills can add bonus rerolls; in this particular example, using "Balance" might give +1 reroll, but "Tightroping" could give +2 rerolls.

Opposed Checks
--------------
A character resisting or disrupting the effects of another's actions may need to roll an *opposed check*. These are made similarly to direct checks, except each succeeding die negates one success from the check being opposed. If all successes are negated from the original check, it fails.

Some opposed checks might be suggested by the GM or rulebook, such as resisting an overt magical effect; others might not be so obvious, or are hidden from the players entirely, and would require a player to use their own perception to call the GM's bluff. Either way, by default, any incoming opposed check that is not contested is a guaranteed success.

.. important::
   Not all rolls made between two contested characters are opposed checks; they are strictly labeled as such. For example, neither an attack nor the parry defending against it are opposed checks.

.. admonition:: Example...
   :class: note

   In combat, an enemy attempts to cast the Command spell on a player character. Since the spell's effect calls for an opposed Insight check, the caster makes their roll and tallies the results while the player reacts in kind with their own Insight check. Should the player roll equal or more successes to the caster's, the spell fails; otherwise, they fall under the caster's spell.

.. admonition:: Another example...
   :class: note

   A player character is interrogating someone for information, wherein the GM has the NPC make an unannounced roll to lie. The player would grow suspicious and - of their own volition - make an Insight check, using their character's "Kenning" skill with the GM's permission. If the same or more successes were rolled than the liar rolled to deceive, the deception is revealed to the player and their character.
