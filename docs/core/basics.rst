🔧 Basic Mechanics
******
FoNS may have a veneer of a traditional fantasy RPG, but most of its mechanics are not shared with the likes of D&D or Pathfinder. It's important to understand these basics before learning the rest of the game.

----------------------------

Rolling Dice
==========

This tabletop system features a "dice pool" mechanic at its core, using six-sided dice almost exclusively. Rolls are made by counting a number of winning dice, instead of wagering a high or low roll on a single die. Each player will want about eight D6 dice, but even more might be necessary in high-level campaigns.

Most actions require a roll, or *check*, to count successes by rolling with d6s. Each die that rolls a 5 or 6 is tallied as one success. Checks between two creatures may pit their rolls against one another, and others will require a static target of winning dice to succeed. Every check has its own way of determining the number of dice and its conditions for success.

| When making a roll, you may have access to a certain number of :term:`rerolls <reroll>`. Immediately after a roll is made (but before it is finalized), you may choose a die for each allowed reroll and roll them again. The better of the two outcomes is then used and tallied with the rest.
| As a rule of thumb, any time a roll would be left with half a die - such as a check with an attribute ending in .5 - a single extra reroll is given instead.

Certain exceptionally easy rolls may also :term:`favor` towards the lower end. A check with +1 favor, for instance, will have a success range of 4-6 instead of 5-6, making it much easier to pass.

Attribute Checks
================
When you are faced with a problem carrying some risk of failure, you may be required to roll an *attribute check*. These come in two different flavors, *direct* and *opposed*, usually called by their associated attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" or "Grace roll" drawing from the Grace attribute.

Direct Checks
-------------
*Direct checks* are usually called when a character takes a risky action that doesn't oppose any others. Your GM declares which attribute should be used. You then roll dice equal to that attribute, adding a number of :term:`bonus dice <die bonus>` equal to your ranks in one relevant skill. If the number of successes equal or surpass the target set by the GM, you win the check.

.. tip::
   Below is a table with example difficulties for direct checks:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Example action
        - Difficulty
      * - **Trivial**: Climb using a rope
        - 1 success, +1 favor
      * - **Average**: Climb a rough surface
        - 1 success
      * - **Difficult**: Climb a wet or flat surface
        - 2 successes
      * - **Extreme**: Climb a sharp surface
        - 3 successes

.. admonition:: Example...
   :class: note

   A player character attempts to tiptoe their way along a narrow branch. The GM calls for a Grace check; the player asks if their "Acrobatics" skill is relevant, and the GM agrees, granting the roll a die bonus equal to their rank in "Burglar", the proficiency that grants them this skill. Highly specific skills can add bonus rerolls; in this particular example, using the "Balance" skill might give +1 reroll, but "Tightroping" could give +2 rerolls.

Opposed Checks
--------------
A character imposing an action on another - or resisting the actions of another - may need to roll an *opposed check*. These are made similarly to direct checks, except each succeeding die negates one success from the check being opposed. If all successes are negated from the original check, it fails.

Some opposed checks might be suggested by the GM or rulebook, such as resisting an overt magical effect. Others might not be so obvious, or are hidden from the players entirely, and would require one's own perception to call the GM's bluff. Either way, by default, any incoming opposed check that is not contested is a guaranteed success.

.. important::
   Opposed checks are not necessarily the same as other contesting rolls, such as attack rolls. For example, neither an attack nor the dodge/parry defending against it are opposed checks.

.. admonition:: Example...
   :class: note

   In combat, an enemy attempts to cast the Command spell on a player character. Since the spell's effect calls for an opposed Insight check, the caster makes their roll and tallies the results while the player reacts in kind with their own Insight check. Should the player roll equal or more successes to the caster's, the spell fails; otherwise, they fall under the caster's spell.

.. admonition:: Another example...
   :class: note

   A player character is interrogating someone for information, wherein the GM has the NPC make an unannounced roll to lie. The player would grow suspicious and - of their own volition - make an Insight check, using their character's "Kenning" skill with the GM's permission. If the same or more successes were rolled than the liar rolled to deceive, the deception is revealed to the player and their character.
