Dice Rolls
==========

UWR features a dice pool mechanic at its core, using d6s almost exclusively. Each player will want about eight six-sided dice, though even more may be
necessary in some cases.

A lot of actions may require a check to count successes by rolling with d6s. Each die that rolls a 5 or above succeeds, while (normally) anything below
fails and is not counted. Checks between two characters may pit these rolls against one another; others will require a static target of winning dice to
succeed. The number of dice to be rolled and the target number of successes can vary drastically in each situation.

Rerolls
-------

When making a check, a character may have access to a certain number of rerolls. Immediately after a roll is made, the player making that roll may
choose a failed die for each allowed reroll, and roll them again. The better of the two outcomes is then used.

Favor
-----

Under most circumstances, rolls will require a 5 or above to succeed for that check. However, for certain exceptionally easy checks, they may favor
towards the lower end. A roll with +1 favor, for instance, will have a success range of 4+ instead of 5+, making it substantially easier to pass.

Attribute Checks
================
When a character is faced with a particularly troublesome task, one where success isn't guaranteed, the GM may require them to roll an Attribute check. These will usually be called by their associated Attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" or "Grace roll" drawing from that character's Grace Attribute.

.. Important::

   If an Attribute has half a point, ending in .5, the Attribute is rounded down to the nearest whole number and a :term:`reroll` is granted to the check instead.

Direct Checks
-------------
Direct checks are usually rolled when a character takes an action that carries some risk of failure, and doesn't oppose any other characters.

The GM declares which primary Attribute should be used (Brawn, Grace, Mettle, Savvy). The player then rolls a number of dice equal to that Attribute, adding a :term:`die bonus` equal to their cumulative ranks in a relevant skill. If the number of successes equal or surpass the target set by the GM, the player wins.

.. Tip::
   Below is a table detailing example difficulties for direct checks, for a GM's perusal:

   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | Example Action                             | Difficulty                  |
   +============================================+=============================+
   | **Easy**: Climb using a rope               | 1 success, +1 :term:`favor` |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Normal**: Climb a rough surface          | 1 success                   |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Difficult**: Climb a wet or flat surface | 2 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
   | **Extreme**: Climb a wet overhang          | 3 successes                 |
   +--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

For example: Ser Laurenz attempts to swim to the bottom of a lake, and the GM calls for a Brawn roll. The player asks if his "Athletics" skill is relevant, and the GM agrees, granting the roll a die bonus equal to Laurenz's rank in "Knight", the proficiency that grants him this skill. Highly specific skills may add bonus rerolls: for example, having a "Swimming" skill may add one; a "Diving" skill may add two instead.

Opposed Checks
--------------
A character resisting or disrupting the effects of another character's actions may need to roll an opposed check. These are made similarly to direct checks, except each success negates one from the other character's check.

.. Tip::

   If two opposed checks roll evenly, the character *reacting to the action made* wins by default.

For example: Inquisitor Hildebrand is interrogating a farm-mouse for information, who makes an attempt to lie to her. In this particular case, Hildebrand's player would make a Savvy check, plus a die bonus equal to her total "Kenning" skill with the GM's permission. If as many or more successes are rolled than the liar rolled to deceive, the deception is revealed.
