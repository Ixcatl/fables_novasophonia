Attributes & Pools
****************************
Whether sapient like common mice and titanic cats or feral like lowly bugs and fish, every living being met in this world features the same basic character statistics.

--------

Primary and Secondary Attributes
================================
Primary attributes represent a creature's raw capabilities, used in the vast majority of rolls and checks. They directly determine the values of their secondary attributes.

.. Note::
      Each primary attribute and each pool (except for Vitality) is capped at a value of 7, the peak of what a mortal critter can attain.

--------

Brawn
=====
A measure of strength and physical fitness.

Brawn determines one's effectiveness at swinging a weapon or parrying incoming blows. For checks, Brawn may be used for shows of brute force, lifting power, or strenuous athleticism.

Load
----
A character's load score is equal to their Brawn rounded down. They may carry weight up to or equal their load without penalty. One may hold more than this limit, up to twice their load, but they will suffer a -1 :term:`die penalty` to all Brawn or Grace based rolls and must spend an additional 1 taxed stamina on any action costing stamina. A character physically cannot carry more than twice their load score.

.. Tip::
      An item marked with Light or 'L' for its weight weighs nothing and does not count against load score. Optionally, at the GM's discretion, light items may instead be counted as 1/3 of a point of weight.

--------
      
Grace
=====
A measure of how fine and swift one can be in their movements.

Grace determines one's effectiveness at using ranged weaponry or dodging incoming danger. For checks, Grace may be used for manual dexterity, balance, or finesse.

Footwork
--------
A character's footwork is equal to half their Grace, rounded up and multiplied by 5. Each round, they may move a distance in paces within enemies' threat range equal to their footwork without provoking an attack of opportunity. Leaving threat range still provokes an attack of opportunity as normal.

--------

Mettle
======
A measure of the thickness of a character's skin, metaphorical or otherwise, and the strength of their resolve.

Whenever a physical attack successfully hits a character, they may roll to soak that damage, using Mettle to ignore flat damage equal to the successes rolled. For checks, Mettle may be used to endure harsh environments, strain one's body, or shake off mental conditions.

Belt Slots
---------
A character has belt slots equal to their Mettle score rounded down. The belt is used to hold various items for quick access in intense situations. One may transfer an item from a hand to an open belt slot, or vice versa, without spending any speed.

Stowing or drawing an item from somewhere other than the belt, picking up or activating an item in the world, all cost speed equal to that item's weight times 5, at a minimum of 5.

.. Note::
      While one may drop an item to the ground without spending any speed, they will have to pick it up later at the typical speed penalty, and until then anyone else can swing by and snatch it out from under them.

--------

Savvy
=====
A measure of the perception, reasoning, and worldly knowledge of a character.

Savvy is used for aspects of occult magic and clever tinkering, in addition to checks using keen senses, sharp intuition, or recalled lore.

Technique Slots
---------------
A character's technique slots are a staging ground for their arts and arcana, assigned for quick and easy use. Characters have technique slots equal to their Savvy rounded down.

--------

Other Attributes
================

Hunger and Belly
----------------
Hunger affects how much food a character must eat, while Belly is determined by hunger and is a measure of how sated they are. One has maximum Belly equal to their hunger value.

Every rest, a character loses Belly equal to their hunger. This loss may lower Belly into negative values. Various effects accumulate as Belly decreases further, as detailed on the following table.

+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Belly Value | Effects                                                                                                    |
+=============+============================================================================================================+
| 0 or Above  | Taking a sleep with 0 or higher Belly fully replenishes a character's Magic, and restores 1 extra Vitality |
|             | for each sleep camp action. They also recover from 1 attribute damage per attribute.                       |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -50 to -1   | A character with this much Belly gains half as much Magic, rounded up, from rest.                          |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -100 to -51 | In addition to the effect above, a character with this much Belly suffers -1 to all primary attributes,    |
|             | but may roll to spot food twice and take the better result.                                                |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Below -100  | The character is dead, having succumbed to starvation.                                                     |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Cool, Cute, and Creep
--------------
These 3 attributes affect how one interacts socially with other characters. They can represent a character's appearance, how they act, or even how they smell. Unlike most other secondary or miscellaneous attributes, these are most often used in associated checks, and follow similar rules to primary attributes. See Social for more information.

Speed
-----
Speed affects how quickly a character can move about. They may move a number of paces each turn equal to their speed value.

Attunement Slots
-------
A character has a base of 3 attunement slots plus their total Path ranks. These are allocated towards equipping magical items and trinkets, bestowing unusual and potentially powerful effects.

Absorption
----------
Some characters have an absorption score. After all DR has reduced the damage risked, and soak has reduced the damage taken, absorption applies. Absorption reduces the damage taken to 1, plus 1 for every time the damage meets the score. Absorption even reduces unusual sources, such as DoT effects or unsoakable damage.

Weight
----
Weight is how much the character *themselves* weighs, should another wish to carry them. Weight may vary considerably between species. If one carries more weight than they weigh themselves, they are treated as the greater of the two.

Size
----
Every character has a size, varying from small, average, or large, as determined from their species. Small and average characters occupy a circle 5 paces in diameter, or one square, while large ones occupy a 10 pace diameter, or 2 squares.

Even larger "huge" characters exist, and their sizes can vary heavily. Huge characters are often immune to effects such as grapples and stuns.

--------

Pools
=====
Unlike attributes, which usually remain static beyond debuffs, pools are active resources which fluctuate regularly as actions are taken and consequences endured. Only Vitality, Stamina, and Magic are common between all characters; several others are available to those with the corresponding playstyles or certain species, and may not even be listed here.

--------

Vitality
--------
The amount of damage a character is able to take before dying.

Taking damage reduces Vitality, and a character reduced to 0 Vitality dies. Particularly driven characters or those controlled by players may enter Death's Door when reduced to 0 Vitality instead.

Stamina
-------
How much one can push themselves in a round of combat.

Most actions taken during combat cost at least 1 Stamina, and additional Stamina can be dedicated to attack and defense rolls. A character's Stamina replenishes each round at the beginning of their turn.

Each rank taken in a martial path increases maximum Stamina by 1.

--------

Magic
-----
A gauge of how much magical potential waxes and wanes within a character.

All spells and certain special actions cost Magic. It is primarily restored by resting.

Magic has a base maximum value equal to half of the character's Savvy rounded up, and each rank taken in a mystic path increases this maximum by 1.

Stash
-----
The amount of materials a particularly inventive critter has to jury-rig items with.

Stash is only accessed when a path or other source grants it, and the base maximum Stash is equal to half of the character's Savvy rounded up.

Given a character knows the recipe for an item or a category of items, Stash can be used to cobble them together on the spot. An item has a Stash cost of 1 for common, 2 for uncommon, and 3 for rare. Created items fall apart or become inert at the end of the scene, due to their improvised nature.

--------

Temporary Pools
===============
Special abilities and effects can provide an additional temporary, or "temp", increase to a character's pools, tracked separately from the rest of the pool and not counting towards the pool's maximum. These additional points go away when they take a rest, unless noted otherwise.

Temp Vitality is always lost first, but the character can otherwise choose whether to spend their regular pools or temp pools.
