Character Attributes & Stats
****************************
Whether sapient like common mice and titanic cats or feral like lowly bugs and fish, every living being met in this world features the same basic character statistics.

--------

Primary and Secondary Attributes
================================
Primary Attributes are a creature's raw capabilities, used in the vast majority of rolls and checks. They directly determine the values of their secondary Attributes.

.. Note::
      Each primary Attribute and each pool (except for Vitality) is capped at a value of 7, the peak of what a mortal creature can attain.

--------

Brawn
=====
A measure of the strength and physical fitness of a character.

Brawn determines one's effectiveness at swinging a weapon or parrying incoming blows. For checks, Brawn may be used for shows of brute force, lifting power, or strenuous athleticism.

Load
----
A character's Load capacity is equal to their Brawn rounded down. They may carry Bulk up to or equal their Load without penalty. A character may carry over this limit, up to twice their Load, but will suffer a -1 :term:`die penalty` to all Brawn or Grace based rolls and must spend an additional 1 tax Stamina on any action costing Stamina. A character physically cannot carry more than twice their Load.

.. Tip::
      An item marked with Light or 'L' for its Bulk weighs nothing. As an optional rule for GMs who want to avoid players carrying around infinite tiny baubles, Light items can instead be counted as 1/3 of a point of Bulk, and simply count them against Load only every third item.

--------
      
Grace
=====
A measure of how fine and swift a character can be in their movements.

Grace determines one's effectiveness at using ranged weaponry or dodging incoming danger. For checks, Grace may be used for manual dexterity, balance, or finesse.

Footwork
--------
A character's Footwork is equal to half its Grace, rounded up. Each round, they may move a number of squares within enemy threat ranges equal to its Footwork without provoking an attack of opportunity. Leaving threat range still provokes an attack from the threatening character.

--------

Mettle
======
A measure of the thickness of a character's skin, metaphorical or otherwise, and the strength of their resolve.

Whenever a physical attack successfully hits a character, they roll Mettle to soak that damage, ignoring damage equal to the successes rolled. For checks, Mettle may be used to endure harsh environments, strain one's body, or shake off mental conditions.

Belt Slots
---------
A character has Belt slots equal to their Mettle score rounded down. The Belt is used to hold various items for quick access in intense situations. One may transfer an item from a hand to an open Belt slot, or vice versa, without spending any Speed.

Stowing or drawing an item from somewhere other than the Belt, picking up or activating an item in the world, all cost Speed equal to that item's Bulk, at a minimum of 1.

.. Note::
      While one may drop an item to the ground without spending any Speed, they will have to pick it up later at the typical Speed penalty, and until then anyone else can swing by and snatch it out from under them.

--------

Savvy
=====
A measure of the perception, reasoning, and worldly knowledge of a character.

Savvy is used for many aspects of occult magic, in addition to checks using keen senses, sharp intuition, or recalled lore.

Technique Slots
---------------
A character's Technique slots are a staging ground for their Arts and Arcana, assigned similarly to keybinds in a video game for quick and easy use. Characters have Technique slots equal to their Insight rounded down.

--------

Other Attributes
================

Hunger and Belly
----------------
Hunger affects how much food a character must eat, while Belly is determined by Hunger and is a measure of how sated they are. One has maximum Belly equal to their Hunger value or 10, whichever is higher.

Every rest, a character loses Belly equal to their Hunger or 10, whichever is higher, and this loss may lower Belly into negative values. Various effects accumulate as Belly decreases further, as detailed on the following table.

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Belly Value | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                         |
+=============+=================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| 0 or Above  | Taking a Sleep with 0 or higher Belly fully replenishes a character's Magic, and restores 1 extra Vitality for each Sleep camp action. They also recover from 1 Attribute damage per Attribute. |
+             +                                                                                                                                                                                                 +
|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -50 to -1   | A character with this much Belly gains half as much Magic, rounded up, from rest.                                                                                                               |

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -100 to -51 | In addition to the effect above, a character with this much Belly suffers -1 to all primary Attributes, but may roll to spot food twice and take the better result.                             |
+             +                                                                                                                                                                                                 +

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Cool, Cute, and Creep
--------------
These 3 Attributes affect how one interacts socially with other characters. They can represent a character's appearance, how they act, or even how they smell. Unlike most other secondary or miscellaneous Attributes, these are most often used in associated checks, and follow similar rules to primary Attributes.

Speed
-----
Speed affects how quickly a character can move about. They may move a number of spaces each turn equal to their Speed value.

Bulk
----
Bulk is how much the character *themselves* weighs, should another wish to carry them. Bulk may vary considerably between species. If one carries more Bulk than they weigh, they are treated as the greater of the two.

Trinket Slots
-------
A character has a base of 2 Trinket slots plus their Path ranks. These are used for equipping Trinkets, curious objects found in the world which may grant unique effects.

Absorption
----------
Some characters have an Absorption score. After all DR has reduced the damage risked, and Soak has reduced the damage taken, Absorption applies. Absorption reduces the damage taken to 1, plus 1 for every time the damage meets the score. Absorption even reduces unusual sources, such as DoT effects or unsoakable damage.

Size
----
Every character has a size, varying from Small, Average, or Large, as determined from their species. Small and Average characters occupy a single square of space, while Large ones occupy a space that is two squares wide in all dimensions.

Even larger characters exist, known as Huge, and their sizes can vary heavily. Huge characters are often immune to effects such as grapples and stuns.
