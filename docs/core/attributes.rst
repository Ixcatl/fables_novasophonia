Character Attributes & Stats
****************

When a character is faced with a particularly troublesome task, one where success isn't guaranteed, the GM may require them to roll an Attribute check. These will usually be called by their associated Attribute, i.e. a "Grace check" or "Grace roll" drawing from that character's Grace Attribute.

Direct Checks
=============

Direct checks are usually rolled when a character takes an action that carries some risk of failure, and doesn't oppose any other characters.

The GM declares which primary Attribute should be used (Brawn, Grace, Mettle, Savvy). The player then rolls a number of dice equal to that Attribute, and adds a :term:`die bonus` equal to their highest rank in a relevant skill. If the number of successes equal or surpass the target set by the GM, the player wins.

.. Important::

   If an Attribute has half a point, ending in .5, the Attribute is rounded down to the nearest whole number and a :term:`reroll` is granted to the check instead.

For example: Ser Laurenz attempts to swim to the bottom of a lake, and the GM calls for a Brawn roll. The player asks if his "Athletics" skill is relevant, and the GM agrees, granting the roll a die bonus equal to Laurenz's rank in "Knight", the proficiency that grants him this skill. Highly specific skills may add bonus rerolls: for example, having a "Swimming" skill may add one; a "Diving" skill may add two instead.

Opposed Checks
===============

A character resisting or disrupting the effects of another character's actions may need to roll an opposed check. These are made similarly to direct checks, except each success negates one from the other character's check.

.. Tip::

   If two opposed checks roll evenly, the character *reacting to the action made* wins by default.

For example: Inquisitor Hildebrand is interrogating a farm-mouse for information, who makes an attempt to lie to her. In this particular case, Hildebrand's player would make a Savvy check, plus a die bonus equal to her highest "Kenning" skill with the GM's permission. If as many or more successes are rolled than the liar rolled to deceive, the deception is revealed.
