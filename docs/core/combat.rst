Initiative & Turn Order
================================
*Initiative* is the order in which every creature makes their turn during combat. At the very beginning of a fight, before anything else occurs, all participants must make a Grace roll to determine initiative. Uniquely, initiative rolls use the sum of all dice rolled instead of tallying successes. The creature with the highest total takes its turn first each round, followed by the rest in descending order, until combat ends.

If two characters have the same initiative, player characters are given priority, followed by non-player allies, then neutral parties, then enemies. Two or more players who are adjacent in the turn order may take their turns simultaneously.

Squares & Game Space
================================
The game world takes place on a three-dimensional square grid, comprised of cubes known as *squares* or *spaces* typically 1 pace (5 feet) in width. While you as a GM could theoretically choose to use precise measurements on a game board instead of strict square spaces, this method isn't playtested or officially supported.

Character Movement
----------------
Any creature or character can move in the eight horizontal directions using their Speed, unless otherwise specified.

Diagonal movement is twice as expensive for every second diagonal moved. Moving both forward and to the right costs 1 Speed overall; the second time costs 3 speed, the third costs 4, ad infinitum. This rule applies against **any movement or range calculation**, which includes normal movement, squares counted for attack range, measuring distance in areas of effect, and more. Any measurement made through all 3 axes of space counts as two diagonals.

Creatures take up physical space in the world. They may *squeeze* into spaces meant for those up to one size smaller than themselves; while doing so, they cannot be passed through by others and suffer a -1 die penalty to both attack and defense rolls. Two creatures cannot squeeze within the same square(s).

A creature may pass through the squares of willing allies, but it must squeeze if stopping in those same square(s). Movement can be made through the square(s) of an enemy, but this immediately provokes an attack of opportunity. Prone or dead creatures may be moved through or stood upon freely.

Generally speaking, a creature may climb a number of wall squares equal to its height using its Speed without necessitating a check for climbing or jumping.

Areas of Effect (AoEs)
----------------
Certain effects may take place across more than one square, known as *areas of effect*, or AoEs. These take four forms - Line, Wide, Cone, or Burst - illustrated below.
