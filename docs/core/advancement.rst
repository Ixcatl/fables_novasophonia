Advancement & Levels
***********
Throughout your party's journey, their encounters and experiences will naturally temper their skills over time. By hitting major milestones in the campaign, the GM may choose to reward their players with a Level-up. You may have conquered a powerful foe, pulled off a big heist, or survived another plane of existence; it's entirely up to interpretation and will vary heavily from party to party.

For new groups, Level 3 is a recommended place to start, since it allows your party to experiment with a bit more creative freedom and explore how their different Paths and features interact. It's also recommended for each player to begin with one Art or Arcanum of their choice, in addition to any they might purchase with Proficiency ranks.

.. tip::
  Here is a table suggesting the order in which a GM should grant Level bonuses, though much like the rest of the rulebook it's not necessarily static:
  
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | Level | Path Ranks | Minor Advancements | Proficiency Ranks |
  +=======+============+====================+===================+
  | 1     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 2     |            | +1                 |                   |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 3     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 4     |            | +1                 |                   |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 5     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | ...   | ad infinitum                                        |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+

Paths
=====
These represent a pawn's approach to combat and the backbone of their playstyle. Each Path may advance up to a maximum of 3 ranks, but a pawn has no limit to the number of different Paths they can take.

When a pawn gains a rank in a Mystic Path, they also learn a single :doc:`Arcanum <catalog/arts-arcana>` associated with that Path.

.. Attention::
  For the full list of Paths, see :doc:`/catalog/paths`.

Minor Advancements
==================
These serve as small buffs to a character, allowing them to better specialize. Minor Advancements can be used to do the following:

* Add +.5 to one Primary Attribute.
* Add +1 to Speed, up to a maximum of 7.
* Add +1 to maximum Load.
* Add 1 new Technique slot.
* Add +1 to the number of times this character can use one of their scene limited Traits or Mastery abilities, such as uses of a recovery flask effect, per scene.

.. Tip::
  When gaining a Path rank, if a character would go over the maximum value for their Path's linked pool (Stamina for Martial and Magic for Mystic), they may instead gain one Minor Advancement in its place. They could even forfeit their pool increase for a Minor Advancement anyways if they so choose, regardless of being at maximum value.
