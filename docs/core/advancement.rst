Advancement & Levels
***********
Throughout your party's journey, their encounters and experiences will naturally temper their skills over time. By hitting some major milestone in the campaign, the GM may choose to reward their players (or pawns) with a *level-up*. You may have conquered a powerful foe, pulled off a big heist, or survived another plane of existence; it's entirely up to interpretation and will vary heavily between parties.

For new groups, level 3 is a recommended place to start, since it allows your party to experiment with a bit more creative freedom and explore how their different paths and features interact. It's also recommended for each player to begin with one art or spell of their choice, in addition to any they might purchase with proficiency ranks.

.. tip::
  Here is a table suggesting the order in which a GM should grant level bonuses, though much like the rest of the rulebook it's not necessarily static:
  
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | Level | Path Ranks | Minor Advancements | Proficiency Ranks |
  +=======+============+====================+===================+
  | 1     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 2     |            | +1                 |                   |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 3     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 4     |            | +1                 |                   |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | 5     | +1         |                    | +1                |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
  | ...   | ad infinitum                                        |
  +-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+

Paths
=====
.. attention::
  For the full list of available paths to choose from, see :doc:`/catalog/paths`.

Taking the role of character classes from traditional tabletop games, *paths* represent a character's approach to combat and the backbone of their playstyle. Each path may advance up to a maximum of 3 ranks, but a character has no limit to the number of different paths they can embark on, leading to unique synergies among them.

| When a new rank in a path is gained, the character receives an additional Attunement point, and gains +1 to the maximum value of their respective pool; Stamina if a martial path, and Anima if a mystic path.
| Additionally, when a character gains a rank in a mystic path, they can learn a single spell associated with that path.

.. note::
  When gaining a path rank, if a character would go over the maximum value for their path's respective pool, they may instead gain one minor advancement in its place - or they could forfeit their pool increase for a minor advancement anyways if they so choose.

Minor Advancements
==================
These serve as small buffs, allowing a pawn to specialize even further. *Minor advancements* can be used for the following:

* Gain +.5 to one primary attribute.
* Gain +1 to Speed, to a maximum of 7.
* Gain +1 to Load.
* Gain 1 Technique slot.
* Grant +1 quality to one of your traits that can receive quality, such as natural weapons, up to a maximum of 3 per trait.
* Add a weapon modifier to one of your eligible natural weapon traits, except Threaded. Natural weapons with the Heavy modifier still don't count against your Load, and only natural projectile weapons can be given the Balanced modifier.
* Gain an additional use of one of your scene-limited abilities - such as traits, mastery abilities, or uses of a recovery flask effect - per scene.
* Animate an eligible item to rank 1, or grant an already Animated item an additional rank.
