Throughout your party's journey, their encounters and experiences will build their character over time. At specific milestones in the campaign, your GM may choose to hand out Level-Ups, most often received after triumphing over a major goal. You may have ventured into a brand new region, conquered a powerful foe, or successfully pulled off a heist. The floor is open for creative interpretation.
