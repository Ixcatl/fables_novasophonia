🔧 Advancement & Levels
***********
Throughout the party's journey, your encounters and experiences would naturally hone your skills. By hitting some major milestone in the campaign, your GM may reward you with a *level-up*. You may have conquered a powerful foe, pulled off a big heist, or survived another realm of existence; it's entirely up to interpretation and will vary heavily between parties.

When leveling up, bonuses are staggered across levels. Every *odd level* rewards one rank in a path of your choosing and one rank in a new or existing proficiency. Every *even level* rewards an advancement.

.. tip::
  You as a GM may choose to grant level up bonuses in whichever order you please, albeit only if you know what you are doing.

| TODO: MOVE TO GM GUIDE SECTION
| For new groups, level 3 is a recommended place to start, since it allows your party to explore level up bonuses with a fair amount of creative freedom. It's also recommended for each player to begin with one art or spell of their choice, in addition to any they might purchase with proficiency ranks.

Paths
=====
.. attention::
  For the full list of available paths to choose from, see :doc:`/catalog/paths`.

Taking the role of character classes, *paths* represent your approach to combat and the backbone of your playstyle. Each path can advance up to a maximum of 3 ranks, but there is no limit to the number of different paths you may embark on, leading to unique synergies among them.

When a new rank in a path is gained, you receive one Attunement point and gain +1 to its maximum respective pool: Stamina if a martial path, Anima if a mystic path. Additionally, when you gain a rank in a mystic path, you learn a single spell associated with that path.

Advancements
==================
*Advancements* are small upgrades to your character, enabling you to specialize even further. An advancement can be traded for one of the following:

* +.5 to one primary attribute.
* +1 to Speed, up to 7.
* +1 to Load.
* +1 Technique slot.
* An advancement trait.
* +1 quality to one of your eligible natural weapons, up to a maximum of 3 per trait.
* A weapon modifier for one of your eligible natural weapons, except Threaded. (Natural weapons with the Heavy modifier still don't count against your Load, and only natural projectile weapons can be given the Balanced modifier.)
* TODO: MAKE THIS AN ADVANCEMENT TRAIT. (1 value. Gain an additional use of one of your scene-limited abilities - such as traits, mastery abilities, or uses of a recovery flask effect - per scene.)

Trading Bonuses
=================
Some bonuses gained on level-up may be traded for others.

* When earning a new rank in a path, you may trade that path's associated pool increase for an additional advancement.
* When earning a new proficiency rank, you may forfeit the rank to instead learn a new spell or weapon art of your choice.
