Advancement & Levels
***********
Throughout your party's journey, their encounters and experiences will temper their skills over time. At specific milestones in the campaign, your GM may choose to hand out Levels, most often received after triumphing over a major goal. You may have ventured into a brand new region, conquered a powerful foe, or successfully pulled off a heist; it's entirely up to interpretation.

For new groups, Level 3 is a recommended place to start, as it allows your party to experiment with a bit more creative freedom and explore how their different Paths and features may interact. It's also recommended for each player to begin with one Art or Arcana of their choice, in addition to any they might purchase with Proficiency ranks.

Here is a table suggesting the order in which a GM should hand out Level bonuses, for NPCs and players alike:

+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| Level | Path Ranks | Minor Advancements | Proficiency Ranks |
+=======+============+====================+===================+
| 1     | +1         |                    | +1                |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| 2     |            | +1                 |                   |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| 3     | +1         |                    | +1                |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| 4     |            | +1                 |                   |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| 5     | +1         |                    | +1                |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ...   | The pattern continues.                              |
+-------+------------+--------------------+-------------------+

Mystic Ranks & Arcana
=====================
When a character gains a rank in a Mystic Path, they also learn a single :doc:`Arcana <catalog/arts-arcana>` from that Path.

Minor Advancements
==================
These serve as small buffs to a character, shoring up stats for a particular build. Minor Advancements can be used to do the following:

* Add +.5 to one Primary Attribute.
* Add +1 to Speed, up to a maximum of 7.
* Add +1 to maximum Load.
* Add 1 new Technique slot.
* Add +1 to the number of times this character can use one of their scene limited Traits or Mastery abilities, such as uses of a recovery flask effect, per scene.
