Advancement & Levels
***********

Throughout your party's journey, their encounters and experiences will temper their skills over time. At specific milestones in the campaign, your GM may choose to hand out Level Ups, most often received after triumphing over a major goal. You may have ventured into a brand new region, conquered a powerful foe, or successfully pulled off a heist; it's entirely up to interpretation.

Below is a table detailing the pattern in which Levels will improve all characters, not only players. For new groups, Level 3 is a recommended place to begin, as it allows your party to experiment with a bit more creative freedom and explore how their different Paths and features may interact.

It's recommended for each character to begin with one Art or Arcana of their choice, in addition to any they might purchase with Proficiency ranks.
