Weapon Arts
***********
Weapon Arts represent the techniques of great warriors, passed down throughout the generations and perfected into a recognizable form.

Preparing Arts
==============
A character readies their Arts for use by assigning them to Technique slots, which may be done freely during any Rest. Any Art assigned to a Technique slot may be used at any time without incurring any penalties.
